She worked in a variety of media but is perhaps best known for her sculpture and reliefs. This is one of a series of sculptures made chiefly from machine stampings. These are the pieces of metal that remain after various standard shapes have been stamped out of the metal by machine.

Ardizzone’ b.l. Watercolour, pen and ink, 7 3/4×10 1/2 (19·5×26·5). Presented by Miss Lillian Browse 1938. Coll: Purchased by Miss Browse from the artist 1931. The artist wrote (7 October 1959) that the scene is Paddington Recreation Ground. He could not be sure when this was painted, but thought it to be a very early work, and added that the colour had faded considerably.

Captain Ardizzone, as one of the first Official War Artists in 1940, was with the British Expeditionary Force at the time of the German advance through Holland and Belgium. In a letter to the compiler he wrote (7 October 1959): ‘Our troops had just retreated from the town [Louvain] having blown the bridges across the railway line.

Watercolour, pen and ink, 22 3/4×30 3/4 (58×78). Presented by the War Artists' Advisory Committee 1946. Exh: National War Pictures, National Gallery, 1945, and R.A., October–November 1945 (797). This records the liberation by the scout cars of the 8th Regiment of Hussars of a prison camp, Stalag 257, on 16 April 1945. The artist recalled (letter of 7 October 1959) that ‘Stalag 257 was enormous and consisted of several encampments. The part shown in the picture was one which contained men who had been in prison for a very long time. What was particularly pathetic about the scene was that, though the gates were thrown open, so many of the prisoners still clung to the wire as if unable to leave.’ Published in: Mary Chamot, Dennis Farr and Martin Butlin, The Modern British Paintings, Drawings and Sculpture, London 1964, I",1.0,1.0,,Vietnam,Haiphong,,

Canvas, 50×40 (127×101). Purchased from the Hanover Gallery (Knapping Fund) 1960. Exh: Hanover Gallery, December 1960–January 1961 (5). Repr: John Rothenstein, The Tate Gallery, 1962, p.261. The artist wrote (14 January 1961) that the picture was painted in London in October 1960, ‘from a series of drawings and water-colours that I made during the summer of the same year at Hillhead in Hampshire’. However, the back of the canvas is inscribed: ‘Adrian Heath Sept. 60’, perhaps the date when the canvas was prepared.

The artist wrote (14 January 1961) that the picture was painted in London in October 1960, ‘from a series of drawings and water-colours that I made during the summer of the same year at Hillhead in Hampshire’. However, the back of the canvas is inscribed: ‘Adrian Heath Sept. 60’, perhaps the date when the canvas was prepared.

The image is an abstract one, with almost figurative forms painted using brushy gestural strokes. There is no evidence that the composition was planned or drawn out before painting. Gaps of buff underlying paint have been left visible between adjacent blocks of colour such that these spaces provide delineation and outlines around the abstracted forms. The painting is well-bound and the artist does not appear to have diluted his paints significantly. The paint is fairly smooth and flat with little impasto except for slightly more loaded brush strokes created using a stiff bush and paste-like paint. There is some wet-in-wet work for example in areas where final touches of white paint have been painted over slightly wet brown and black paint, to create a layered partially blended effect. There is also evidence for paint applied over fully dried underlying passages, suggesting the painting was created over a period of time rather than in one sitting. The palette is dominated by brown (iron oxide) and black (bone black pigment), but streaks of bright red (cadmium red), pink and white provide contrast and interest. Castor wax was found as an additive in the oil paints which is a common tube paint additive used as a rheology modifier (to adjust the flow behaviour of paint, e.g. its viscosity) in modern oil paint formulations. Zinc soaps were found in the brown paint, which may also be present as a paint additive, used to give the paint a buttery consistency. Calcium carbonate (chalk) and barium sulphate have been found in the paints. These are common extender pigments used to bulk out manufactured tube paints. The painting is in excellent condition. Some small areas of cadmium red paints are water sensitive. Water sensitivity is commonly encountered in unvarnished oil paintings of the twentieth century and is an area of concurrent research (see the Cleaning Modern Oil Paints project).

They used a variety of found materials, and their compositions were often developed through an understanding of the process of growth in plants and animals, as well through theories of proportion. Heath emphasised the physical qualities of the work by building it up with blocks of thickly applied paint. In 1954 Heath wrote ‘The thing of interest is the actual life of the work: its growth from a particular white canvas or board… It is the process, the method of development that is the life of the painting.’",1.0,1.0,,Myanmar,Myanmar,,

In a letter of 1 February 1972, the artist wrote that ‘At this period most of my pictures had included collage elements (card or thick paper) during the early stages. They were used like counters in a game to mark the state of development of a particular composition and they helped me to think in terms of area. I always liked the juxtaposition of “ready-made” surfaces with painted ones but I usually resorted to paint as being more permanent when colour was involved. “White Composition” was one of my first works to show an interest in curved forms.’ Published in The Tate Gallery Report 1970–1972, London 1972.",1.0,1.0,,Myanmar,Myanmar,,

Victor Pasmore, recently converted to abstraction, was at the centre of the group and Heath was influenced by Pasmore's switch to objective abstraction.

Both are based on information supplied by the artist in reply to questions in November 1975 and March 1977, and have been approved by her. ‘Intervals I’ is in an edition of three examples, in one of which the wood is painted a pale tint. The Tate's example and the other unpainted example were surface treated with polyurethane sealer and sandpapered down to avoid a ‘varnished’ look. ‘Intervals I’ may be displayed in either of two ways. It may be hung upright against a flat wall, resting by its top rung on supports (made as unobtrusive as possible) placed close to its central spine; when displayed in this position, the bottom edge of the work should be between 9 and 20 inches above the floor at the installer's discretion and depending on the scale of the room. Alternatively it may be placed, the central spine almost vertical, with its bottom edge on the floor and its top edge leaning against the wall; in this position the bottom edge should be between 2 and 9 inches away from the wall, again at the installer's discretion. Although a work in its own right, and in an edition as described above, ‘Intervals I’ is also part of a larger work entitled ‘Intervals I plus II’ 1973, which belongs to the Tate Gallery alone and which is described in the entry (below) on its other component part, ‘Intervals II’.

Both are based on information supplied by the artist in reply to questions in November 1975 and March 1977, and have been approved by her. ‘Intervals I’ is in an edition of three examples, in one of which the wood is painted a pale tint. The Tate's example and the other unpainted example were surface treated with polyurethane sealer and sandpapered down to avoid a ‘varnished’ look. ‘Intervals I’ may be displayed in either of two ways. It may be hung upright against a flat wall, resting by its top rung on supports (made as unobtrusive as possible) placed close to its central spine; when displayed in this position, the bottom edge of the work should be between 9 and 20 inches above the floor at the installer's discretion and depending on the scale of the room. Alternatively it may be placed, the central spine almost vertical, with its bottom edge on the floor and its top edge leaning against the wall; in this position the bottom edge should be between 2 and 9 inches away from the wall, again at the installer's discretion. Although a work in its own right, and in an edition as described above, ‘Intervals I’ is also part of a larger work entitled ‘Intervals I plus II’ 1973, which belongs to the Tate Gallery alone and which is described in the entry (below) on its other component part, ‘Intervals II’.

This work is in an edition of three examples, all unpainted. There were no drawings for it (or for ‘Intervals I’). Kim Lim had the materials for both sculptures unused in her studio for about a year before formulating the works. The initial inspiration for her sculptures comes usually (as on this occasion) from her response to materials she has around her. She then works, from the start, in the scale she intends to use. For the Tate's works she made full-size maquettes in the same material she intended for the final sculptures. Not being machine-cut, these maquettes were destroyed after the finished works had been cut to specifications, jointed and glued (by a woodwork firm). Like ‘Intervals I’, ‘Intervals II’ was surface treated with polyurethane sealer and sandpapered down to avoid a ‘varnished’ look. None of the elements in either work has a ‘top’, ‘bottom’, ‘back’ or ‘front’. Unlike ‘Intervals I’, ‘Intervals II’ cannot be displayed flat against a wall. It may be displayed in any one of three arrangements, viz:- Intervals IIA, in which the two elements are placed side by side, separated by a gap of between 1 3/4 and 4 inches (at the installer's discretion), with prongs facing ‘outwards’ in opposite directions, the central spines almost vertical, the bottom edges on the floor and the top edges leaning against the wall. As in the leaning version of ‘Intervals I’, the bottom edges (which should be aligned) should be between 2 and 9 inches away from the wall, at the installer's discretion. Intervals IIB, which is the same as ‘Intervals IIA’ except that the two sets of prongs point ‘inwards’ towards one another. However, unlike ‘Intervals IIA’, ‘Intervals IIB’ may also be displayed flat on the floor (at no point touching a wall). Intervals IIC, in which the spines of the two elements are placed so as to touch the floor continuously and be parallel with one another, and the two elements intersect, supporting one another at a diagonal angle, with each prong touching a prong of the other element (not at their tips), no further means of support being required. In this position, the work should not at any point touch a wall In addition to being displayed at the owner's discretion in any of these ways, each of the three examples of ‘Intervals II’ can also be displayed in a fourth arrangement unique to it. Of these alternative arrangements, two do not belong to the Tate. In the first of these the spines of the two elements are placed parallel to one another, touching the floor continuously, close to one another but not touching, and the prongs point vertically upwards. In the second non-Tate arrangement, (‘Intervals IIE’) the elements are placed flat on the floor, spines parallel, with the two sets of prongs pointing ‘inwards’, each prong abutting one prong of the other element, and also touching the other element's spine. The arrangement of ‘Intervals II’ that is unique to the Tate integrates it with ‘Intervals I’ and is called ‘Intervals I plus II’. In this work the three elements are leaned against the wall aligned and at the same discretionary distances (one from another and all from the wall) as in ‘Intervals IIA’ and ‘Intervals IIB’. The central element is ‘Intervals I’ and the prongs of the two elements of ‘Intervals II’ (which it separates) point ‘inwards’. In notes written for the Tate Gallery in March 1977, Kim Lim explained how these works manifest her interest in ‘that space between wall and floor-the tension set up by the vertical, horizontal and the angle’. This interest first appeared openly in her sculpture in untitled works of 1970 and 1971. One of these consists of two boards each some 6 feet high by 9 inches wide which are leaned, aligned, against the wall with a small gap between them; in front of them a disc with a hollow centre lies horizontal, almost on the floor but crucially not quite touching it as it is supported on low blocks, thus appearing to float. This work is in wood painted pale pink. The other work, which is painted dark blue and leans against the wall, is a wider board out of which square sections have been cut at regular intervals down its length. In such a work ‘rhythms are set up in the piece itself, and forms caused by light falling on the piece repeat the rhythms like an echo. In works such as Intervals I and II and even more so in “Link” [acrylic tube and painted wood, 1975], light becomes an important element in the structure of the piece-making the work more “physical”, “comprehensible”. The works that follow the Intervals Series are pieces using mainly wood, and are a continuation of the same preoccupation with space, rhythms and light-I avoid “development” because it seems to imply a progression that starts at one end in a linear way-whereas my pattern of working seems more cyclic-certain forms and ideas reappear sometimes quite a few years later.’ Images very close to those of ‘Intervals I’ and ‘Intervals II’ are used in four prints by Kim Lim made in the previous year, ‘Ladder Series’ 1972, Nos. 1, 2,3 and 4. She writes ‘the two activities-making sculpture and print making-are of equal importance to me. The difference being that sculpture, for me, is a rather slow process while working on a plate or wood block can produce quick feedback-so that ideas I am involved in during a period sometimes appear first in the prints.’ Published in: The Tate Gallery 1974-6: Illustrated Catalogue of Acquisitions, London 1978",1.0,1.0,,Singapore,Singapore,,

This work is in an edition of three examples, all unpainted. There were no drawings for it (or for ‘Intervals I’). Kim Lim had the materials for both sculptures unused in her studio for about a year before formulating the works. The initial inspiration for her sculptures comes usually (as on this occasion) from her response to materials she has around her. She then works, from the start, in the scale she intends to use. For the Tate's works she made full-size maquettes in the same material she intended for the final sculptures. Not being machine-cut, these maquettes were destroyed after the finished works had been cut to specifications, jointed and glued (by a woodwork firm). Like ‘Intervals I’, ‘Intervals II’ was surface treated with polyurethane sealer and sandpapered down to avoid a ‘varnished’ look. None of the elements in either work has a ‘top’, ‘bottom’, ‘back’ or ‘front’. Unlike ‘Intervals I’, ‘Intervals II’ cannot be displayed flat against a wall. It may be displayed in any one of three arrangements, viz:- Intervals IIA, in which the two elements are placed side by side, separated by a gap of between 1 3/4 and 4 inches (at the installer's discretion), with prongs facing ‘outwards’ in opposite directions, the central spines almost vertical, the bottom edges on the floor and the top edges leaning against the wall. As in the leaning version of ‘Intervals I’, the bottom edges (which should be aligned) should be between 2 and 9 inches away from the wall, at the installer's discretion. Intervals IIB, which is the same as ‘Intervals IIA’ except that the two sets of prongs point ‘inwards’ towards one another. However, unlike ‘Intervals IIA’, ‘Intervals IIB’ may also be displayed flat on the floor (at no point touching a wall). Intervals IIC, in which the spines of the two elements are placed so as to touch the floor continuously and be parallel with one another, and the two elements intersect, supporting one another at a diagonal angle, with each prong touching a prong of the other element (not at their tips), no further means of support being required. In this position, the work should not at any point touch a wall In addition to being displayed at the owner's discretion in any of these ways, each of the three examples of ‘Intervals II’ can also be displayed in a fourth arrangement unique to it. Of these alternative arrangements, two do not belong to the Tate. In the first of these the spines of the two elements are placed parallel to one another, touching the floor continuously, close to one another but not touching, and the prongs point vertically upwards. In the second non-Tate arrangement, (‘Intervals IIE’) the elements are placed flat on the floor, spines parallel, with the two sets of prongs pointing ‘inwards’, each prong abutting one prong of the other element, and also touching the other element's spine. The arrangement of ‘Intervals II’ that is unique to the Tate integrates it with ‘Intervals I’ and is called ‘Intervals I plus II’. In this work the three elements are leaned against the wall aligned and at the same discretionary distances (one from another and all from the wall) as in ‘Intervals IIA’ and ‘Intervals IIB’. The central element is ‘Intervals I’ and the prongs of the two elements of ‘Intervals II’ (which it separates) point ‘inwards’. In notes written for the Tate Gallery in March 1977, Kim Lim explained how these works manifest her interest in ‘that space between wall and floor-the tension set up by the vertical, horizontal and the angle’. This interest first appeared openly in her sculpture in untitled works of 1970 and 1971. One of these consists of two boards each some 6 feet high by 9 inches wide which are leaned, aligned, against the wall with a small gap between them; in front of them a disc with a hollow centre lies horizontal, almost on the floor but crucially not quite touching it as it is supported on low blocks, thus appearing to float. This work is in wood painted pale pink. The other work, which is painted dark blue and leans against the wall, is a wider board out of which square sections have been cut at regular intervals down its length. In such a work ‘rhythms are set up in the piece itself, and forms caused by light falling on the piece repeat the rhythms like an echo.

This work relates to sculptures she has made outdoors, where planes of stone are positioned close to the surface of water. In the case of this sculpture carved from Rose Aurora marble, water is not present but is suggested. As in other works she has made which respond to natural forces, this has a strong sense of poetry. At the same time it is a block of particularly beautiful marble and the sculptor has fully exploited its potential of colour and texture by the way she has shaped and worked it.",1.0,1.0,,Singapore,Singapore,,

She was known primarily as a sculptor in wood and marble, but also made a number of prints and drawings. This group of woodcuts was purchased in 1999. A further ten prints were donated by the Contemporary Art Society in memory of Cecily Lowenthal, who was a long serving member of the Tate Guides and a close friend of the artist.

The element at the base is the narrowest of the three. The central element is elongated and has two circular metal rings inserted into it. The element at the top is positioned off-centre and, on one of its flat surfaces, it has a deep groove carved out vertically. Cracks along the grain of the wood suggest its history and uneven drying process. Sphinx was made the year before Kim Lim completed her studies at the Slade School of Fine Art, London. Since being a student at St. Martin’s School of Art and then at the Slade, Lim enjoyed the direct engagement with the material involved in the process of carving wood, working from a given shape and taking away. While still a student, Lim began to salvage, carve and assemble wood off-cuts found in wood yards. Assemblage allowed Lim to create from building blocks, with given forms and histories, and insert them into playful configurations that are harmonious yet seemingly off-balance. Lim did not paint the wood, as she wanted to maintain the original vitality of her materials. Instead, she scorched the surface so that various sections would acquire distinctive textures and reflect the light differently. ‘There was a kind of innocence and an arrogance at the same time,’ Lim later said of her early sculptures of the late 1950s and early 1960s (Kim Lim, interviewed by Cathy Courtney, Artists’ Lives, National Life Stories, British Library, C466/51, 1995, track 8, tape 5, side A, p.103 of the transcript). Like her prints from the same period, such as Shogun 1960 (Tate P07176), these formative sculptures have a distinct sense of wholeness and balance, combined with a certain boldness and rawness. The title Sphinx speaks of the artist’s love of ancient artefacts and evokes the still elegance and eroded surface of the Sphinx of Gaza in Egypt. Lim stated: ‘I found that I always responded to things that were done in earlier civilisations that seemed to have less elaboration and more strength’ (Kim Lim, undated notes from the artist’s personal archive). The tension between simple, clear and at times archaic forms and abstraction remained recurring threads throughout her career. The choice of title might also hinge on the enduring fascination among artists and writers for the hybrid quality of the mythical creature, used as a reference by other artists who experienced displacement, exile and diaspora, as in the case of Hilde Goldschmidt’s The Sphinx 1948 (Tate T03350). Over the years, Sphinx has been displayed in slightly different configurations, but the artist’s estate has confirmed that the correct, original configuration is with the top, ovoid element resting on the thicker part of the middle element rather than on the sloping part.

Totemic in nature, it is 1.6 metres tall and comprises the base, a post and, at the top, four non-orthogonal elements. Of these, one develops horizontally and the other three vertically, visually continuing the vertical development of the post and suggesting a degree of feathery lightness. As its subtitle suggests, the work exists in two different versions: a red version made in painted wood, Borneo 2 (Wood) 1964, and this metal version made in spray-painted green steel. Borneo 2 (Steel) was realised after the wooden version and presents a very high, smooth finish. In the 1960s Lim worked with a number of different materials, for a period electing to use painted steel. She drew from a range of cultural and visual traditions while developing an increasingly simple visual language. Borneo 2 (Steel) emphasises structure on a flat plane. The top part appears weightless, a life-size version of a two-dimensional cut-out; while the vertical, square-based ‘column’ suggests volume and strength. Prior to this, as a student in London at St. Martin’s School of Art and then at the Slade School of Fine Art, Lim had made sculptures in wood, enjoying the direct engagement with the material involved in the process of carving, working from a given shape and taking away. She began to salvage, carve and assemble wood off-cuts found in wood yards. In early sculptures such as Sphinx 1959 (Tate T15938), assemblage allowed her to create works from building blocks, with given forms and histories, and insert them into playful configurations that are harmonious yet seemingly off-balance. Lim did not paint the wood, as she wanted to maintain the original vitality of her materials. Instead, she scorched the surface so that various sections would acquire distinctive textures and reflect the light differently. While Kim Lim’s subsequent work remained consistently abstract, the totemic structure and title of Borneo 2 (Steel), together with the formal qualities of its bird-like top part, suggest the possibility of figurative and allegorical readings. It might in part be an homage to the sculptural birds of Constantin Brancusi (1876–1957), an artist Lim admired deeply. It might, given the title, also reference the birdlife of the Southeast Asian island of Borneo. Compared to other artists in Britain who in the early 1960s began working with steel, such as Anthony Caro (1924–2013), Lim opted for more poetic and personal references. Lim was born in Singapore and grew up primarily in the Malaysian peninsula. However, her paternal grandparents had migrated from south China to Sarawak, the Malaysian state on the north coast of Borneo. Hence, the work can be seen as referencing her family history of migration and relocation and her mixed cultural heritage.

By contrast, the square-based column supporting it suggests volume and strength. Lim’s title introduces a personal reference.

At the bottom of the tube is a quantity of soapy liquid that is turned into foam by compressors located inside the wooden portions of the sculpture. This results in the foam being projected upwards and out of the tube, forming a jet of bubbles that extends above head-height. The plastic of the tube is clear, such that once the bubbles are released they can be seen rising up inside the tube. The bubbles are produced constantly and form cloud-like clusters at the top of the tube, and once these clusters have been propelled upwards they drop back and slide slowly down the exterior of the tube to its base, where they rejoin the bath of soapy liquid from which they came. Cloud Canyons No. 3: An Ensemble of Bubble Machines (Auto Creative Sculptures) was made by the Filipino artist David Medalla in 1961. It is among the earliest of several ‘bubble machines’ that Medalla produced at the time and first exhibited in 1964 at Signals Gallery in London, a space devoted to international kinetic art that Medalla co-founded that same year. Cloud Canyons No. 3 bears the additional date of 2004, as it was recreated that year for the exhibition Art & The 60s: This Was Tomorrow at Tate Britain in London. Although the materials and construction for Cloud Canyons No. 3 are controlled by Medalla each time it is installed, the sculpture changes constantly once it is on display due to the varying shapes formed by the foam. In an interview in 1979, Medalla noted that he had been attempting with his sculptures to give ‘tangible form to invisible forces ... to find a model which would show the transformation of matter into energy’ (quoted in Araeen 1997, p.11), and the words ‘cloud’ and ‘canyon’ in the work’s title reflect the artist’s interest in the random shapes formed by the earth’s natural processes. The art critic Guy Brett has described the first installation of Cloud Canyons No. 3 in 1964 as follows: The foam was allowed to follow its own aleatory paths, emerging and forming according to its own energies interacting with gravity, air currents, atmospheric pressure, and the shape of the containers ... the analogy with clouds was no exaggeration. It was never the same two days in a row.(Brett 1995, p.53.) In creating his series of Cloud Canyons, Medalla drew on a range of artistic practices as well as scientific theories that were emerging at the time. He was inspired by the ‘auto-destructive’ sculptures of the Polish artist Gustav Metzger, a friend of Medalla who was also involved with Signals Gallery, and by current research into relativity and cellular biology. Medalla has explained that his use of bubbles was also connected to specific childhood memories, including the clouds in tropical sunsets in Manila; watching his mother cooking; a visit to a brewery in Edinburgh; and the frothing mouth of a wounded Japanese soldier he discovered in the family garden. Although his work was inspired by personal experience, Medalla was concerned with breaking the boundary between the spectator and the artwork and intended for viewers to bring their own personal interpretations to the cloud-like forms created by the bubble machines. He said in 1968: The most important thing is to give life to materials, so that instead of finding ourselves separate from them, we find a complete dialogue with the material.(Quoted in Brett 1995, p.62.) Photographs of the bubbles created by Medalla’s work were reproduced in the Signals Gallery Newsbulletin in September 1964. In the accompanying text, Metzger called Medalla ‘the first master of auto-creative art’, implying that Medalla’s practice was a variation on Metzger’s own auto-destructive art. Metzger argued that the bubble machines were ‘capable of achieving not only the most complex forms and motions but also an aesthetic content of the highest order’, and that they were extensions of the work of earlier modernist sculptors such as Constantin Brancusi, Hans Arp, Alexander Calder and Naum Gabo. In 1968, Signals member Paul Keeler showed a copy of the September 1964 Newsbulletin to the artist Marcel Duchamp, who subsequently created an edition of one hundred sculptures entitled Medallic Object that took the form of a medal bursting with bubble-shaped forms.

At the bottom of the tube is a quantity of soapy liquid that is turned into foam by compressors located inside the wooden portions of the sculpture. This results in the foam being projected upwards and out of the tube, forming a jet of bubbles that extends above head-height. The plastic of the tube is clear, such that once the bubbles are released they can be seen rising up inside the tube. The bubbles are produced constantly and form cloud-like clusters at the top of the tube, and once these clusters have been propelled upwards they drop back and slide slowly down the exterior of the tube to its base, where they rejoin the bath of soapy liquid from which they came. Cloud Canyons No. 3: An Ensemble of Bubble Machines (Auto Creative Sculptures) was made by the Filipino artist David Medalla in 1961. It is among the earliest of several ‘bubble machines’ that Medalla produced at the time and first exhibited in 1964 at Signals Gallery in London, a space devoted to international kinetic art that Medalla co-founded that same year.

Presented on a white plinth, the artwork takes the form of a shallow metal tray of sand, from the centre of which a small section of silver birch tree protrudes vertically. Atop this is a square pane of glass, from the corners of which are suspended two lengths of bamboo cane. The ends of the bamboo are connected by a length of copper wire threaded with brightly coloured, ornate glass beads. A rotating mechanism concealed in the length of birch creates a slowly turning motion by which the beads create a circular ‘calligraphic’ impression in the sand; a trace which is continuously renewed in each thirty-second rotation. The apparent precariousness of the work’s construction is in keeping with the artist’s ongoing questioning of the generalisation that sculpture must be monumental, static and timeless. The use of organic matter, prevalent across much of Medalla’s work, distinguishes his practice from that of his artistic contemporaries Takis (born 1925) and Jean Tinguely (1925–1991), whose kinetic sculptures were constructed primarily from synthetic and non-organic materials including metal and magnets. Guy Brett – who exhibited Medalla and Takis at his short-lived yet ground-breaking gallery Signals London (1964–6) – coined the term ‘biokinetics’ to describe Medalla’s practice, which draws upon the scientific disciplines of biology and physics, which the artist then additionally inflects with cosmic or fantastical elements through his titles and descriptions. Medalla has made a number of ‘sand machines’, works which are most closely associated with the Signals period of his career. He has described them specifically as ‘a metaphor for the future, when technology will be able to use solar power to help irrigate the world’s deserts’ (David Medalla, quoted in Brett 1995, p.56). Sand Machine Bahag – Hari Trance #1 is thematically aligned with other related works by the artist, being informed by his experiences of migration as he has explained: the initial inspiration for my first sand machine came from my memories of the rice terraces of the mountain provinces of the Philippines, where I spent one year of my boyhood as a student at St. Mary’s School in Sagada. I also witnessed a sandstorm in the Sahara desert on my way to Europe in the spring of 1960 … The other sand machines I made, for the exhibition ‘Force Fields’ curated by Guy Brett at MACBA in Barcelona, and at the Hayward Gallery in London in 1999, were of a more festive nature and reminded me of the happy times I spent on the beaches in the Philippine Islands, like the island of Cebu where my mother came from. (Quoted in Nankervis 2011, accessed 1 August 2018.) The title combines both English and Filipino words – whilst the ‘sand machine’ aspect is mainly descriptive, the word ‘bahaghari’ is broken up by a hyphen. ‘Bahag’ alone refers to the bahag loincloth, a form of indigenous, pre-colonial Filipino dress. When the title is read aloud in its entirety, however, the word bahaghari translates as ‘rainbow’, conjuring up ideas of hope and optimism, specifically in its universal symbolism for LGBT movements across the world. This poetic description exemplifies Medalla’s expanded perception of time and space – abstract concepts that he conflates in his art to create a sense of shared humanity. These characteristics are also central to his series of ‘bubble machines’, such as Cloud Canyons No. 3: An Ensemble of Bubble Machines (Auto Creative Sculptures) 1961, remade 2004 (Tate T12201).

The footage is shown on a white, double-sided projection screen that measures 253 x 450 cm and is hung in the middle of the gallery space. The two films are projected onto either side of the screen and play simultaneously. One video comprises close-up shots that present the archers from behind and from either side. Some of these shots show the women lining up and firing their arrows, while others zoom in to focus on details of their bodies and dress, including their ears, necks and the colourful pins and flowers that decorate their hair. In this film, the archers’ silent concentration contrasts with the sound of a crowd of spectators that is played through speakers that are placed near to the screen. The video projected onto the other side of the screen shows close-up and usually partial shots of the women’s faces as they stretch their bows, fire their arrows and prepare to shoot again. In this video the close-range filming of the women’s faces means that viewers cannot see the archers’ targets, so that it remains unclear whether or not the shots are successful. The women generally do not show strong facial expressions but they frequently look down while readying their bows, and this often gives them a melancholic appearance. This impression is accentuated by the atmospheric electronic music that plays on this side of the screen. The Australian artist Fiona Tan shot the two films on location in Kyoto, Japan, in 2001. They were filmed during the annual Toshiya ceremony, a coming-of-age ritual that has been held in Kyoto’s Sanjûsangen-dô Buddhist temple for more than four hundred years. Every January young men and women come to Kyoto from across Japan to take part in the ceremony, one element of which is a major tournament of kyudo, which the curator Gregor Muir has described as ‘a Japanese style of archery which is not so much about hitting a target, as an exercise in fluidity and smoothness’ (Muir in Tate Modern 2004, p.44). Saint Sebastian was inspired by Tan’s first visit to Japan in 2000 when, during a trip to the Sanjûsangen-dô temple, she found a postcard showing young women practising kyudo. After intensively researching the sport, which had scarcely been documented before, Tan and a small film crew were granted permission to film at the temple during Toshiya. The artist was particularly interested in what she saw as kyudo’s strange combination of themes, ideas and roles, which include ‘traditional ritual and modern day Japanese women, religious practice and military inheritance, youth and cultural history’ (quoted in De Pont Foundation for Contemporary Art 2003, p.49). The title of the work refers to the Christian patron saint of archers and soldiers. The martyrdom of Saint Sebastian, which involved the saint being tied to a stake and shot at with arrows, is a common subject in the history of European painting. In titling her film Saint Sebastian Tan introduces notions of cultural difference, since archery takes on very different associations in kyudo and in the Buddhist context of the Sanjûsangen-dô temple. Tan has outlined the symbolism of archery in the Buddhist faith as follows: There is a Confucian belief that through a person’s archery their true character could be determined. The sound of the string being plucked is supposed to strike fear in evil spirits’ hearts, and the sound of a master-archer shooting is supposed to bring spiritual enlightenment.(Quoted in De Pont Foundation for Contemporary Art 2003, p.50.) Furthermore, Tan has explained that the practice of archery, as well as forming the subject of the film, is itself analogous to filmmaking. In 2003 she drew a comparison between the two through the importance of distance and accuracy: The art of archery and the art of art. The target is so far away that it seems irrelevant. My tools are the camera and the editing table ... A true shot in kyudo is not just one that hits the centre of the target, but one where the arrow can be said to exist in the target before its release.(Quoted in De Pont Foundation for Contemporary Art 2003, p.53.) Tan was born in Indonesia, grew up in Australia and has lived in Europe since the age of eighteen. Her work engages critically with documentary cinema and photography, especially in relation to the representation of different cultures. In the years leading up to the creation of Saint Sebastian Tan made two full-length documentary films, May you live in interesting times 1997 and Kingdom of Shadows 2000 (both on general release). Like Saint Sebastian, these films document practices from various cultures and draw on the history of ethnographic and anthropological cinema. In Saint Sebastian the lack of narration – a technique used in the documentary genre cinéma vérité to suggest that the audience is seeing an unmediated view of the subject – contrasts with the method of cutting between different, often obscured shots and the use of highly evocative music. Each of these techniques draws attention to the artist’s mediation of the women’s appearance and activities. Tan has acknowledged this mediation, stating in 2001 that ‘as an outsider to this culture my touristic gaze cannot be avoided; if anything it will become a part of the piece’ (quoted in De Pont Foundation for Contemporary Art 2003, p.51). Curator Els Hoek has argued that while Tan’s film ‘has unmasked the shameless gaze of the traveller – not to mention the rude manners of the colonialist’, the tender intimacy of the close-up shots in Saint Sebastian equally ‘proves that the mechanical eye can also be in love, be involved with the people whom it registers’ (Hoek in De Pont Foundation for Contemporary Art 2003, p.30).

The series exists in an edition of five of which Tate’s copy is number one. The photographs can be shown as a full set, in smaller groups, or as individual works. Although the artist has previously displayed them pinned directly to the wall, they can also be framed. There is no particular order in which they need to be displayed. The photographs feature people whose faces are hidden by tropical fruits, which act as substitutes for heads. Some photographs show a group of people, while others show individuals. Some were taken inside houses; others were taken outside. There are numerous variations on the subjects’ poses and accoutrements, often suggesting work or leisure activities, such as playing golf, fishing or drinking tea. A variety of fruits appear in the series, including watermelons, durians, jackfruits and bunches of bananas. The subjects of the photographs go about their business as if it were normal to have fruit heads. The colourful compositions and absurd combination of fruit heads and human bodies convey a surreal, humorous and cartoon-like aesthetic. As the title suggests, the photographs were taken at the turn of the twenty-first century. A Small Town at the Turn of the Century is representative of Gill’s practice, in which modification and transformation are important concepts. As curator Jessica Morgan has written: ‘Not only do people become fruit, but also books become vegetation, discarded or crushed objects develop mobility, photographs become sculpture, people become books, and books become beads’ (Morgan in Museum of Contemporary Art Sydney 2008, p.60). Transformation is found in Gill’s work on a number of different levels, including artistic genres and media as well as subject matter, questioning and blurring the lines between fixed categorisations. By morphing her sitters’ faces into fruits, Gill equates them with the tropical vegetation associated with their country while leading the artistic genres of portrait and still life to the point of absurdity. The motif of combining human subjects with plants can also be found in a number of Gill’s earlier photographic series. Out of my Hair 1995 (Art Gallery of New South Wales, Sydney), for instance, includes a photograph of a woman who wears a wig made from banana skins. Vegetation 1999 (Art Gallery of New South Wales, Sydney), on the other hand, consists of self-portraits of the artist, whose face is disguised by various plant species local to the landscapes in which the photographs were taken. A Small Town at the Turn of the Century is also representative of Gill’s practices as a whole in its use of natural materials. Her photographs, installations and object-based works often include fruits, fruit skins, tree roots or seeds. While using a cheerful and humorous language, A Small Town at the Turn of the Century nevertheless raises critical questions around identity and postcolonialism. The combination of human subjects with fruits invokes the close relationship between humankind and the plant world and the interrelations between culture and nature. Hiding the faces behind fruits, Gill also shows how identities can be hidden and new ones imposed upon them through visual appearance and habitat. Gill addresses the possibility of multiple and changing identities by demonstrating the arbitrary and manipulable nature of their formation. Furthermore, the playful equation of the Malaysian sitters with tropical fruits raises questions regarding stereotypical associations of other cultures: as with the Malaysian fruits that are exported to the West as exotic products, so Malaysian people are defined by their ‘otherness’. The colourful fruit also playfully allude to traditional memento mori paintings; the lifespan of the fruits, as well as of the people they conceal, is necessarily limited. In addition to photography, Gill’s practice encompasses a variety of other media, including installation, sculpture and writing. As is the case with A Small Town at the Turn of the Century, and the slightly later Dalam 2001 (Tate P14285), her work is often organised in series, challenging rigid typologies and classifications.

Nine of the photographs are black and white gelatin silver prints and twenty are colour Ilfochrome prints. They can be shown as a full set, in smaller groups or as individual works; there is no specified order in which the pictures are to be hung. The series exists in an edition of two, of which this is the second, plus one artist’s proof. The photographs show the coastal environment of Port Dickson, framed and criss-crossed by mangrove trees. Entangled in the branches and projecting roots are colourful plastic bags and other items of domestic detritus that have been washed up by the rise and fall of the daily tides. Hanging almost like clothes on a washing line, these plastic and fabric remnants have been integrated into Gill’s compositions like an integral part of the landscape. One photograph in the series does not show any litter on the shore, but rather an expanse of sea with a large ship approaching the port. Channel is one of a number of series in which Gill has been concerned with Port Dickson. She has been recording the industrial port town since 1993, using a range of different media from installations of cubes made from termite soil from the area, to photographic series such as Channel. An earlier series of forty photographs, A Small Town at the Turn of the Century 1999–2000 (Tate P13507), includes images shot at the same beach where Channel was made (prints #1, #4 and #16 of A Small Town at the Turn of the Century). Channel is representative of Gill’s practice, in which the use of natural materials and ideas of modification are important concepts. Curator Jessica Morgan has written: ‘Not only do people become fruit, but also books become vegetation, discarded or crushed objects develop mobility, photographs become sculpture, people become books, and books become beads.’ (Jessica Morgan, ‘No Place like Home’, in Storer, Morgan and Taussig 2008, p.60.) Transformation is thus an element of the work on a number of levels, including artistic genres and media as well as the objects photographed. Gill routinely collects shells, driftwood, plastic bottles and shards on the beach, classifying these found objects according to form, colour and material. By choosing to photograph items entangled in the trees, she has added another layer to this practice. The fact that Channel comprises both black and white and colour photographs suggests that the artist was looking at each individual object and scene in detail, for its compositional effect, and exploiting the qualities of the different photographic prints and processes. The gelatin silver prints focus on the dynamic forms of the trees, tangled pieces of litter and the water; the ilfochrome prints accentuate the colours of the found objects and the surrounding environment. Focusing on normally overlooked litter, shaped and expelled by the sea, Channel draws attention to the shipping of products to and from Port Dickson and, more widely, raises questions about migration and globalisation. The contamination of the mangrove forest by plastic waste invokes the complex and difficult relationship between humankind and the environment. In using her last remaining stocks of Ilfochrome paper – which is no longer manufactured – to print the twenty colour photographs of the Channel series, Gill highlights the transient nature of everyday life and our impact on an ever-changing environment, as well as the fugitive nature of the photographic medium itself.

In using her last remaining stocks of Ilfochrome paper – which is no longer manufactured – to print the twenty colour photographs of the Channel series, Gill highlights the transient nature of everyday life and our impact on an ever-changing environment, as well as the fugitive nature of the photographic medium itself.

Nine of the photographs are black and white gelatin silver prints and twenty are colour Ilfochrome prints. They can be shown as a full set, in smaller groups or as individual works; there is no specified order in which the pictures are to be hung. The series exists in an edition of two, of which this is the second, plus one artist’s proof. The photographs show the coastal environment of Port Dickson, framed and criss-crossed by mangrove trees. Entangled in the branches and projecting roots are colourful plastic bags and other items of domestic detritus that have been washed up by the rise and fall of the daily tides. Hanging almost like clothes on a washing line, these plastic and fabric remnants have been integrated into Gill’s compositions like an integral part of the landscape. One photograph in the series does not show any litter on the shore, but rather an expanse of sea with a large ship approaching the port. Channel is one of a number of series in which Gill has been concerned with Port Dickson. She has been recording the industrial port town since 1993, using a range of different media from installations of cubes made from termite soil from the area, to photographic series such as Channel. An earlier series of forty photographs, A Small Town at the Turn of the Century 1999–2000 (Tate P13507), includes images shot at the same beach where Channel was made (prints #1, #4 and #16 of A Small Town at the Turn of the Century). Channel is representative of Gill’s practice, in which the use of natural materials and ideas of modification are important concepts. Curator Jessica Morgan has written: ‘Not only do people become fruit, but also books become vegetation, discarded or crushed objects develop mobility, photographs become sculpture, people become books, and books become beads.’ (Jessica Morgan, ‘No Place like Home’, in Storer, Morgan and Taussig 2008, p.60.) Transformation is thus an element of the work on a number of levels, including artistic genres and media as well as the objects photographed. Gill routinely collects shells, driftwood, plastic bottles and shards on the beach, classifying these found objects according to form, colour and material. By choosing to photograph items entangled in the trees, she has added another layer to this practice. The fact that Channel comprises both black and white and colour photographs suggests that the artist was looking at each individual object and scene in detail, for its compositional effect, and exploiting the qualities of the different photographic prints and processes. The gelatin silver prints focus on the dynamic forms of the trees, tangled pieces of litter and the water; the ilfochrome prints accentuate the colours of the found objects and the surrounding environment. Focusing on normally overlooked litter, shaped and expelled by the sea, Channel draws attention to the shipping of products to and from Port Dickson and, more widely, raises questions about migration and globalisation. The contamination of the mangrove forest by plastic waste invokes the complex and difficult relationship between humankind and the environment. In using her last remaining stocks of Ilfochrome paper – which is no longer manufactured – to print the twenty colour photographs of the Channel series, Gill highlights the transient nature of everyday life and our impact on an ever-changing environment, as well as the fugitive nature of the photographic medium itself.

Nine of the photographs are black and white gelatin silver prints and twenty are colour Ilfochrome prints. They can be shown as a full set, in smaller groups or as individual works; there is no specified order in which the pictures are to be hung. The series exists in an edition of two, of which this is the second, plus one artist’s proof. The photographs show the coastal environment of Port Dickson, framed and criss-crossed by mangrove trees. Entangled in the branches and projecting roots are colourful plastic bags and other items of domestic detritus that have been washed up by the rise and fall of the daily tides. Hanging almost like clothes on a washing line, these plastic and fabric remnants have been integrated into Gill’s compositions like an integral part of the landscape. One photograph in the series does not show any litter on the shore, but rather an expanse of sea with a large ship approaching the port. Channel is one of a number of series in which Gill has been concerned with Port Dickson. She has been recording the industrial port town since 1993, using a range of different media from installations of cubes made from termite soil from the area, to photographic series such as Channel. An earlier series of forty photographs, A Small Town at the Turn of the Century 1999–2000 (Tate P13507), includes images shot at the same beach where Channel was made (prints #1, #4 and #16 of A Small Town at the Turn of the Century). Channel is representative of Gill’s practice, in which the use of natural materials and ideas of modification are important concepts. Curator Jessica Morgan has written: ‘Not only do people become fruit, but also books become vegetation, discarded or crushed objects develop mobility, photographs become sculpture, people become books, and books become beads.’ (Jessica Morgan, ‘No Place like Home’, in Storer, Morgan and Taussig 2008, p.60.) Transformation is thus an element of the work on a number of levels, including artistic genres and media as well as the objects photographed. Gill routinely collects shells, driftwood, plastic bottles and shards on the beach, classifying these found objects according to form, colour and material. By choosing to photograph items entangled in the trees, she has added another layer to this practice. The fact that Channel comprises both black and white and colour photographs suggests that the artist was looking at each individual object and scene in detail, for its compositional effect, and exploiting the qualities of the different photographic prints and processes. The gelatin silver prints focus on the dynamic forms of the trees, tangled pieces of litter and the water; the ilfochrome prints accentuate the colours of the found objects and the surrounding environment. Focusing on normally overlooked litter, shaped and expelled by the sea, Channel draws attention to the shipping of products to and from Port Dickson and, more widely, raises questions about migration and globalisation. The contamination of the mangrove forest by plastic waste invokes the complex and difficult relationship between humankind and the environment. In using her last remaining stocks of Ilfochrome paper – which is no longer manufactured – to print the twenty colour photographs of the Channel series, Gill highlights the transient nature of everyday life and our impact on an ever-changing environment, as well as the fugitive nature of the photographic medium itself.

Focusing on normally overlooked litter, shaped and expelled by the sea, Channel draws attention to the shipping of products to and from Port Dickson and, more widely, raises questions about migration and globalisation. The contamination of the mangrove forest by plastic waste invokes the complex and difficult relationship between humankind and the environment. In using her last remaining stocks of Ilfochrome paper – which is no longer manufactured – to print the twenty colour photographs of the Channel series, Gill highlights the transient nature of everyday life and our impact on an ever-changing environment, as well as the fugitive nature of the photographic medium itself.

Nine of the photographs are black and white gelatin silver prints and twenty are colour Ilfochrome prints. They can be shown as a full set, in smaller groups or as individual works; there is no specified order in which the pictures are to be hung. The series exists in an edition of two, of which this is the second, plus one artist’s proof. The photographs show the coastal environment of Port Dickson, framed and criss-crossed by mangrove trees. Entangled in the branches and projecting roots are colourful plastic bags and other items of domestic detritus that have been washed up by the rise and fall of the daily tides. Hanging almost like clothes on a washing line, these plastic and fabric remnants have been integrated into Gill’s compositions like an integral part of the landscape. One photograph in the series does not show any litter on the shore, but rather an expanse of sea with a large ship approaching the port. Channel is one of a number of series in which Gill has been concerned with Port Dickson. She has been recording the industrial port town since 1993, using a range of different media from installations of cubes made from termite soil from the area, to photographic series such as Channel. An earlier series of forty photographs, A Small Town at the Turn of the Century 1999–2000 (Tate P13507), includes images shot at the same beach where Channel was made (prints #1, #4 and #16 of A Small Town at the Turn of the Century). Channel is representative of Gill’s practice, in which the use of natural materials and ideas of modification are important concepts. Curator Jessica Morgan has written: ‘Not only do people become fruit, but also books become vegetation, discarded or crushed objects develop mobility, photographs become sculpture, people become books, and books become beads.’ (Jessica Morgan, ‘No Place like Home’, in Storer, Morgan and Taussig 2008, p.60.) Transformation is thus an element of the work on a number of levels, including artistic genres and media as well as the objects photographed. Gill routinely collects shells, driftwood, plastic bottles and shards on the beach, classifying these found objects according to form, colour and material. By choosing to photograph items entangled in the trees, she has added another layer to this practice. The fact that Channel comprises both black and white and colour photographs suggests that the artist was looking at each individual object and scene in detail, for its compositional effect, and exploiting the qualities of the different photographic prints and processes. The gelatin silver prints focus on the dynamic forms of the trees, tangled pieces of litter and the water; the ilfochrome prints accentuate the colours of the found objects and the surrounding environment. Focusing on normally overlooked litter, shaped and expelled by the sea, Channel draws attention to the shipping of products to and from Port Dickson and, more widely, raises questions about migration and globalisation. The contamination of the mangrove forest by plastic waste invokes the complex and difficult relationship between humankind and the environment. In using her last remaining stocks of Ilfochrome paper – which is no longer manufactured – to print the twenty colour photographs of the Channel series, Gill highlights the transient nature of everyday life and our impact on an ever-changing environment, as well as the fugitive nature of the photographic medium itself.

Nine of the photographs are black and white gelatin silver prints and twenty are colour Ilfochrome prints. They can be shown as a full set, in smaller groups or as individual works; there is no specified order in which the pictures are to be hung. The series exists in an edition of two, of which this is the second, plus one artist’s proof. The photographs show the coastal environment of Port Dickson, framed and criss-crossed by mangrove trees. Entangled in the branches and projecting roots are colourful plastic bags and other items of domestic detritus that have been washed up by the rise and fall of the daily tides. Hanging almost like clothes on a washing line, these plastic and fabric remnants have been integrated into Gill’s compositions like an integral part of the landscape. One photograph in the series does not show any litter on the shore, but rather an expanse of sea with a large ship approaching the port. Channel is one of a number of series in which Gill has been concerned with Port Dickson. She has been recording the industrial port town since 1993, using a range of different media from installations of cubes made from termite soil from the area, to photographic series such as Channel. An earlier series of forty photographs, A Small Town at the Turn of the Century 1999–2000 (Tate P13507), includes images shot at the same beach where Channel was made (prints #1, #4 and #16 of A Small Town at the Turn of the Century). Channel is representative of Gill’s practice, in which the use of natural materials and ideas of modification are important concepts. Curator Jessica Morgan has written: ‘Not only do people become fruit, but also books become vegetation, discarded or crushed objects develop mobility, photographs become sculpture, people become books, and books become beads.’ (Jessica Morgan, ‘No Place like Home’, in Storer, Morgan and Taussig 2008, p.60.) Transformation is thus an element of the work on a number of levels, including artistic genres and media as well as the objects photographed. Gill routinely collects shells, driftwood, plastic bottles and shards on the beach, classifying these found objects according to form, colour and material. By choosing to photograph items entangled in the trees, she has added another layer to this practice. The fact that Channel comprises both black and white and colour photographs suggests that the artist was looking at each individual object and scene in detail, for its compositional effect, and exploiting the qualities of the different photographic prints and processes. The gelatin silver prints focus on the dynamic forms of the trees, tangled pieces of litter and the water; the ilfochrome prints accentuate the colours of the found objects and the surrounding environment. Focusing on normally overlooked litter, shaped and expelled by the sea, Channel draws attention to the shipping of products to and from Port Dickson and, more widely, raises questions about migration and globalisation. The contamination of the mangrove forest by plastic waste invokes the complex and difficult relationship between humankind and the environment. In using her last remaining stocks of Ilfochrome paper – which is no longer manufactured – to print the twenty colour photographs of the Channel series, Gill highlights the transient nature of everyday life and our impact on an ever-changing environment, as well as the fugitive nature of the photographic medium itself.

Focusing on normally overlooked litter, shaped and expelled by the sea, Channel draws attention to the shipping of products to and from Port Dickson and, more widely, raises questions about migration and globalisation. The contamination of the mangrove forest by plastic waste invokes the complex and difficult relationship between humankind and the environment. In using her last remaining stocks of Ilfochrome paper – which is no longer manufactured – to print the twenty colour photographs of the Channel series, Gill highlights the transient nature of everyday life and our impact on an ever-changing environment, as well as the fugitive nature of the photographic medium itself.

Nine of the photographs are black and white gelatin silver prints and twenty are colour Ilfochrome prints. They can be shown as a full set, in smaller groups or as individual works; there is no specified order in which the pictures are to be hung. The series exists in an edition of two, of which this is the second, plus one artist’s proof. The photographs show the coastal environment of Port Dickson, framed and criss-crossed by mangrove trees. Entangled in the branches and projecting roots are colourful plastic bags and other items of domestic detritus that have been washed up by the rise and fall of the daily tides. Hanging almost like clothes on a washing line, these plastic and fabric remnants have been integrated into Gill’s compositions like an integral part of the landscape. One photograph in the series does not show any litter on the shore, but rather an expanse of sea with a large ship approaching the port. Channel is one of a number of series in which Gill has been concerned with Port Dickson. She has been recording the industrial port town since 1993, using a range of different media from installations of cubes made from termite soil from the area, to photographic series such as Channel. An earlier series of forty photographs, A Small Town at the Turn of the Century 1999–2000 (Tate P13507), includes images shot at the same beach where Channel was made (prints #1, #4 and #16 of A Small Town at the Turn of the Century). Channel is representative of Gill’s practice, in which the use of natural materials and ideas of modification are important concepts. Curator Jessica Morgan has written: ‘Not only do people become fruit, but also books become vegetation, discarded or crushed objects develop mobility, photographs become sculpture, people become books, and books become beads.’ (Jessica Morgan, ‘No Place like Home’, in Storer, Morgan and Taussig 2008, p.60.) Transformation is thus an element of the work on a number of levels, including artistic genres and media as well as the objects photographed. Gill routinely collects shells, driftwood, plastic bottles and shards on the beach, classifying these found objects according to form, colour and material. By choosing to photograph items entangled in the trees, she has added another layer to this practice. The fact that Channel comprises both black and white and colour photographs suggests that the artist was looking at each individual object and scene in detail, for its compositional effect, and exploiting the qualities of the different photographic prints and processes. The gelatin silver prints focus on the dynamic forms of the trees, tangled pieces of litter and the water; the ilfochrome prints accentuate the colours of the found objects and the surrounding environment. Focusing on normally overlooked litter, shaped and expelled by the sea, Channel draws attention to the shipping of products to and from Port Dickson and, more widely, raises questions about migration and globalisation. The contamination of the mangrove forest by plastic waste invokes the complex and difficult relationship between humankind and the environment. In using her last remaining stocks of Ilfochrome paper – which is no longer manufactured – to print the twenty colour photographs of the Channel series, Gill highlights the transient nature of everyday life and our impact on an ever-changing environment, as well as the fugitive nature of the photographic medium itself.

Nine of the photographs are black and white gelatin silver prints and twenty are colour Ilfochrome prints. They can be shown as a full set, in smaller groups or as individual works; there is no specified order in which the pictures are to be hung. The series exists in an edition of two, of which this is the second, plus one artist’s proof. The photographs show the coastal environment of Port Dickson, framed and criss-crossed by mangrove trees. Entangled in the branches and projecting roots are colourful plastic bags and other items of domestic detritus that have been washed up by the rise and fall of the daily tides. Hanging almost like clothes on a washing line, these plastic and fabric remnants have been integrated into Gill’s compositions like an integral part of the landscape. One photograph in the series does not show any litter on the shore, but rather an expanse of sea with a large ship approaching the port. Channel is one of a number of series in which Gill has been concerned with Port Dickson. She has been recording the industrial port town since 1993, using a range of different media from installations of cubes made from termite soil from the area, to photographic series such as Channel. An earlier series of forty photographs, A Small Town at the Turn of the Century 1999–2000 (Tate P13507), includes images shot at the same beach where Channel was made (prints #1, #4 and #16 of A Small Town at the Turn of the Century). Channel is representative of Gill’s practice, in which the use of natural materials and ideas of modification are important concepts. Curator Jessica Morgan has written: ‘Not only do people become fruit, but also books become vegetation, discarded or crushed objects develop mobility, photographs become sculpture, people become books, and books become beads.’ (Jessica Morgan, ‘No Place like Home’, in Storer, Morgan and Taussig 2008, p.60.) Transformation is thus an element of the work on a number of levels, including artistic genres and media as well as the objects photographed. Gill routinely collects shells, driftwood, plastic bottles and shards on the beach, classifying these found objects according to form, colour and material. By choosing to photograph items entangled in the trees, she has added another layer to this practice. The fact that Channel comprises both black and white and colour photographs suggests that the artist was looking at each individual object and scene in detail, for its compositional effect, and exploiting the qualities of the different photographic prints and processes. The gelatin silver prints focus on the dynamic forms of the trees, tangled pieces of litter and the water; the ilfochrome prints accentuate the colours of the found objects and the surrounding environment. Focusing on normally overlooked litter, shaped and expelled by the sea, Channel draws attention to the shipping of products to and from Port Dickson and, more widely, raises questions about migration and globalisation. The contamination of the mangrove forest by plastic waste invokes the complex and difficult relationship between humankind and the environment. In using her last remaining stocks of Ilfochrome paper – which is no longer manufactured – to print the twenty colour photographs of the Channel series, Gill highlights the transient nature of everyday life and our impact on an ever-changing environment, as well as the fugitive nature of the photographic medium itself.

Focusing on normally overlooked litter, shaped and expelled by the sea, Channel draws attention to the shipping of products to and from Port Dickson and, more widely, raises questions about migration and globalisation. The contamination of the mangrove forest by plastic waste invokes the complex and difficult relationship between humankind and the environment. In using her last remaining stocks of Ilfochrome paper – which is no longer manufactured – to print the twenty colour photographs of the Channel series, Gill highlights the transient nature of everyday life and our impact on an ever-changing environment, as well as the fugitive nature of the photographic medium itself.

Nine of the photographs are black and white gelatin silver prints and twenty are colour Ilfochrome prints. They can be shown as a full set, in smaller groups or as individual works; there is no specified order in which the pictures are to be hung. The series exists in an edition of two, of which this is the second, plus one artist’s proof. The photographs show the coastal environment of Port Dickson, framed and criss-crossed by mangrove trees. Entangled in the branches and projecting roots are colourful plastic bags and other items of domestic detritus that have been washed up by the rise and fall of the daily tides. Hanging almost like clothes on a washing line, these plastic and fabric remnants have been integrated into Gill’s compositions like an integral part of the landscape. One photograph in the series does not show any litter on the shore, but rather an expanse of sea with a large ship approaching the port. Channel is one of a number of series in which Gill has been concerned with Port Dickson. She has been recording the industrial port town since 1993, using a range of different media from installations of cubes made from termite soil from the area, to photographic series such as Channel. An earlier series of forty photographs, A Small Town at the Turn of the Century 1999–2000 (Tate P13507), includes images shot at the same beach where Channel was made (prints #1, #4 and #16 of A Small Town at the Turn of the Century). Channel is representative of Gill’s practice, in which the use of natural materials and ideas of modification are important concepts. Curator Jessica Morgan has written: ‘Not only do people become fruit, but also books become vegetation, discarded or crushed objects develop mobility, photographs become sculpture, people become books, and books become beads.’ (Jessica Morgan, ‘No Place like Home’, in Storer, Morgan and Taussig 2008, p.60.) Transformation is thus an element of the work on a number of levels, including artistic genres and media as well as the objects photographed. Gill routinely collects shells, driftwood, plastic bottles and shards on the beach, classifying these found objects according to form, colour and material. By choosing to photograph items entangled in the trees, she has added another layer to this practice. The fact that Channel comprises both black and white and colour photographs suggests that the artist was looking at each individual object and scene in detail, for its compositional effect, and exploiting the qualities of the different photographic prints and processes. The gelatin silver prints focus on the dynamic forms of the trees, tangled pieces of litter and the water; the ilfochrome prints accentuate the colours of the found objects and the surrounding environment. Focusing on normally overlooked litter, shaped and expelled by the sea, Channel draws attention to the shipping of products to and from Port Dickson and, more widely, raises questions about migration and globalisation. The contamination of the mangrove forest by plastic waste invokes the complex and difficult relationship between humankind and the environment. In using her last remaining stocks of Ilfochrome paper – which is no longer manufactured – to print the twenty colour photographs of the Channel series, Gill highlights the transient nature of everyday life and our impact on an ever-changing environment, as well as the fugitive nature of the photographic medium itself.

Nine of the photographs are black and white gelatin silver prints and twenty are colour Ilfochrome prints. They can be shown as a full set, in smaller groups or as individual works; there is no specified order in which the pictures are to be hung. The series exists in an edition of two, of which this is the second, plus one artist’s proof. The photographs show the coastal environment of Port Dickson, framed and criss-crossed by mangrove trees. Entangled in the branches and projecting roots are colourful plastic bags and other items of domestic detritus that have been washed up by the rise and fall of the daily tides. Hanging almost like clothes on a washing line, these plastic and fabric remnants have been integrated into Gill’s compositions like an integral part of the landscape. One photograph in the series does not show any litter on the shore, but rather an expanse of sea with a large ship approaching the port. Channel is one of a number of series in which Gill has been concerned with Port Dickson. She has been recording the industrial port town since 1993, using a range of different media from installations of cubes made from termite soil from the area, to photographic series such as Channel. An earlier series of forty photographs, A Small Town at the Turn of the Century 1999–2000 (Tate P13507), includes images shot at the same beach where Channel was made (prints #1, #4 and #16 of A Small Town at the Turn of the Century). Channel is representative of Gill’s practice, in which the use of natural materials and ideas of modification are important concepts. Curator Jessica Morgan has written: ‘Not only do people become fruit, but also books become vegetation, discarded or crushed objects develop mobility, photographs become sculpture, people become books, and books become beads.’ (Jessica Morgan, ‘No Place like Home’, in Storer, Morgan and Taussig 2008, p.60.) Transformation is thus an element of the work on a number of levels, including artistic genres and media as well as the objects photographed. Gill routinely collects shells, driftwood, plastic bottles and shards on the beach, classifying these found objects according to form, colour and material. By choosing to photograph items entangled in the trees, she has added another layer to this practice. The fact that Channel comprises both black and white and colour photographs suggests that the artist was looking at each individual object and scene in detail, for its compositional effect, and exploiting the qualities of the different photographic prints and processes. The gelatin silver prints focus on the dynamic forms of the trees, tangled pieces of litter and the water; the ilfochrome prints accentuate the colours of the found objects and the surrounding environment. Focusing on normally overlooked litter, shaped and expelled by the sea, Channel draws attention to the shipping of products to and from Port Dickson and, more widely, raises questions about migration and globalisation. The contamination of the mangrove forest by plastic waste invokes the complex and difficult relationship between humankind and the environment. In using her last remaining stocks of Ilfochrome paper – which is no longer manufactured – to print the twenty colour photographs of the Channel series, Gill highlights the transient nature of everyday life and our impact on an ever-changing environment, as well as the fugitive nature of the photographic medium itself.

The overall effect is of an undulating translucent field where the light glows amidst the rice. As with many of Phaophanit’s works, light plays an important role in this installation, binding together the different materials to achieve a particular visual effect. In addition to the work’s visual impact, the rice also generates its own particular smell, which pervades the space beyond the physical limits of the piece. For the artist, Neon Rice Field relies on the ‘interactions of the materials’ (quoted in Tate Gallery 1993, [p.6]) and brings together two utterly disparate things, one natural and organic and the other manufactured and industrial. These materials carry cultural associations that have often been inscribed within the dichotomy between the Western and the Eastern worlds (in this instance, of industry versus agriculture). However, the cultural allegiances that might be attached to them are more complex, more problematic and more fluid than any dualistic reading allows for. Phaophanit often infuses into his work a discreet subversion of the narratives attached to the materials and, while rice is unequivocally a symbol for the East, he has in the past used American sponsorship to supply the rice to stage his work. Likewise, the presence of neon which could sometimes be assumed to represent the western city is also a feature of many Asian cities. Unwilling to attach any predetermined meanings to the work, Phaophanit is concerned with the potential for ‘possibilities of meanings’, and he considers that the materials and their juxtapositions carry their own significance while, at the same time, they open the way to new associations. ‘Once you name all the meanings,’ he has said, ‘something still remains, something left over. That’s how I work. For instance, I use rice not only as a material, a substance, a smell or a symbol of food in the East, but I want to shake things – see what falls down.’ (Quoted in Irish Museum of Modern Art 1997, p. 96.) Born in Laos and educated in France, Phaophanit settled in England in 1985. In 1990 he began to incorporate in his work materials such as rice, rubber and bamboo, which are largely produced in South East Asia and have economic, cultural and historical significance. However, Phaophanit has always opposed any readings of his work that reduce it to a reflection on his cultural identity: Such biographical discourse is very limiting when it comes to talking about the work itself. I don’t only make my work as I do simply because I’m a refugee. It’s also concerned with the way I’m living at the moment. I don’t want to be categorised. I don’t want to be ‘French’ or ‘English’. And I don’t want to be ‘Laotian’.(Vong Phaophanit interviewed by Jonathan Watkins, in Vong Phaophanit: What Falls to the Ground but Can’t be Eaten, exhibition catalogue, Chisenhale Gallery, London 1991, unpaginated.) Neon Rice Field was first exhibited at the Serpentine Gallery, London in 1993 and later the same year at the Aperto section of the 45th Venice Biennale. It was subsequently shown as Phaophanit’s contribution to the Turner Prize at the Tate Gallery, London in 1993. Over the years, it has been shown in different configurations but always incorporating seven tons of white rice spread over six lines of neon lights.

It consists of seven videos of differing durations in which the history of the border town of Nabua, in northeast Thailand, is re-imagined as an elusive science fiction ghost story rooted in Thai folklore. The work comprises eight projections, since one of the videos, Primitive which gives the work its name, is shown on two synchronised screens. The seven videos are: Primitive (duration 29 minutes 34 seconds), Nabua (duration 9 minutes 11 seconds), Making of the Spaceship (duration 28 minutes 13 seconds), A Dedicated Machine (duration 1 minute), An Evening Shoot (duration 4 minutes 10 seconds), I'm Still Breathing (music video, duration 11 minutes) and Nabua Song (music video, duration 4 minutes 12 seconds). Nabua, situated where the Mekong River divides Thailand from Laos, was historically the scene of considerable racial strife and violence. From the 1960s until the early 1980s it was a ‘red zone’ where the Mao-influenced Communists hid in the jungle. The Thai army curbed the communist insurgent farmers through physical and psychological abuse and murder. The town also harbours an ancient legend about a widow ghost who would abduct any man who entered her empire, earning it the nickname ‘widow town’. Weerasethakul transforms the town into one of men, the teenage male descendants of the farmer communists, freed from the widow ghost’s empire. These teenagers fabricate their own memories and build a new world, manufacturing a spaceship in the ricefields. For Weerasethakul the jungle is a place of darkness and mystery, in which distinctions between the fictional and the real dissolve. It is a parallel world, populated by enchanted spectres, where mystery and emotion mingle in shadow. The jungle forms a perfect stage for the artist’s fascination with reincarnation, transformation and light. Curator James Quandt has commented that Weerasethakul’s work turns ‘everyday objects and images into the ineffable and enigmatic, inhabitants of a phantom zone where the hard, “real” world of cars and bodies and buildings cedes dominion to a magical realm of reverie and desire’ (Österreichisches Filmmuseum and SYNEMA – Gesellschaft für Film und Medien 2009). The artist has stated that Primitive is ‘a reincarnation of presence (and absence). It’s also a reincarnation of cinema as a means of transportation as it was in the time of the early cinema innovator Georges Méliès: the ‘motion picture’ carries us from our own world. Primitive is a meditation on those voyages in fabulous vehicles that bring about the transformation of people and of light’ (unpublished artist’s statement, September 2008). Inspired in part by surrealism, Weerasethakul’s films present a world that is distinctly mutable and elusive, evoking the artist’s interest in the surrealist game Exquisite Corpse, whereby players add words or images sequentially to a sentence or diagram without knowing what came before, so as to construct a fanciful, multi-layered scenario. Conventional narrative unravels as storylines change course and genre morphs from fiction to fantasy to documentary. Drawing heavily on anecdotal traditions from rural Thai villagers, as well as personal politics, social issues and his own early fascination with science fiction, Weerasethakul crafts a unique approach to history which is seemingly caught in an endless cycle of dreams.

It consists of seven videos of differing durations in which the history of the border town of Nabua, in northeast Thailand, is re-imagined as an elusive science fiction ghost story rooted in Thai folklore. The work comprises eight projections, since one of the videos, Primitive which gives the work its name, is shown on two synchronised screens. The seven videos are: Primitive (duration 29 minutes 34 seconds), Nabua (duration 9 minutes 11 seconds), Making of the Spaceship (duration 28 minutes 13 seconds), A Dedicated Machine (duration 1 minute), An Evening Shoot (duration 4 minutes 10 seconds), I'm Still Breathing (music video, duration 11 minutes) and Nabua Song (music video, duration 4 minutes 12 seconds). Nabua, situated where the Mekong River divides Thailand from Laos, was historically the scene of considerable racial strife and violence. From the 1960s until the early 1980s it was a ‘red zone’ where the Mao-influenced Communists hid in the jungle. The Thai army curbed the communist insurgent farmers through physical and psychological abuse and murder. The town also harbours an ancient legend about a widow ghost who would abduct any man who entered her empire, earning it the nickname ‘widow town’. Weerasethakul transforms the town into one of men, the teenage male descendants of the farmer communists, freed from the widow ghost’s empire. These teenagers fabricate their own memories and build a new world, manufacturing a spaceship in the ricefields. For Weerasethakul the jungle is a place of darkness and mystery, in which distinctions between the fictional and the real dissolve. It is a parallel world, populated by enchanted spectres, where mystery and emotion mingle in shadow. The jungle forms a perfect stage for the artist’s fascination with reincarnation, transformation and light. Curator James Quandt has commented that Weerasethakul’s work turns ‘everyday objects and images into the ineffable and enigmatic, inhabitants of a phantom zone where the hard, “real” world of cars and bodies and buildings cedes dominion to a magical realm of reverie and desire’ (Österreichisches Filmmuseum and SYNEMA – Gesellschaft für Film und Medien 2009). The artist has stated that Primitive is ‘a reincarnation of presence (and absence). It’s also a reincarnation of cinema as a means of transportation as it was in the time of the early cinema innovator Georges Méliès: the “motion picture” carries us from our own world. Primitive is a meditation on those voyages in fabulous vehicles that bring about the transformation of people and of light’ (unpublished artist’s statement, September 2008). Inspired in part by surrealism, Weerasethakul’s films present a world that is distinctly mutable and elusive, evoking the artist’s interest in the surrealist game Exquisite Corpse, whereby players add words or images sequentially to a sentence or diagram without knowing what came before, so as to construct a fanciful, multi-layered scenario. Conventional narrative unravels as storylines change course and genre morphs from fiction to fantasy to documentary. Drawing heavily on anecdotal traditions from rural Thai villagers, as well as personal politics, social issues and his own early fascination with science fiction, Weerasethakul crafts a unique approach to history which is seemingly caught in an endless cycle of dreams.

They are part of a series that Abad developed from the late 1970s until the early 1980s. Referring to them as trapuntos, from the Italian word for embroidery or quilt, these works are the artist’s responses to the cultural traditions that she encountered during her travels in Asia, Africa and Latin America, although they also refer to vernacular traditions of sewing – a traditional part of family education in the Philippines. They were made using large pieces of canvas onto which the artist stitched forms, creating a three-dimensional effect by stuffing the canvases and transforming their surface with paint, shells, buttons, beads, mirrors and other objects collected on her travels. Their decorated surfaces integrate a range of patterning techniques to create semi-figurative forms with what look like large eyes set in stylised, mask-like faces. Abad dispensed with stretcher bars and hung these works directly on the wall or from the ceiling and this, combined with the distinctive technique, transformed the relatively flat surface of a picture into something more multi-dimensional. The portability of the trapunto form can be said to resonate with the peripatetic aspect of a migrant existence as experienced by the artist, being an object that can theoretically be rolled up and more easily transported than a stretched painting. Inspired by her travels and interest in responding to cultural traditions in Indonesia, Bangladesh, Sudan, Philippines and elsewhere, Abad’s aim in her work was to connect with the world through a vibrant formal language that integrated her interest in traditional art forms such as batik painting in Indonesia, ink-brush painting in Korea, tie-dye in Africa and macramé in Papua New Guinea, all within a language of abstraction and figuration. Dismayed by Western-centric artistic styles while studying at the Corcoran School of Art in Washington D.C. in the mid-1970s, Abad became interested in social realism and also encountered works by the Mexican muralists Diego Rivera (1886–1957), David Siqueiros (1896–1974) and José Clemente Orozco (1883–1949) during a trip to Mexico in 1986. She sought to rejuvenate different artistic traditions and indigenous forms in order to respond to the social and political realities of communities she encountered, in particular refugees, immigrants and others at the margins of society. Of the artist’s motivations, the curators Joselina Cruz and Pio Abad have written: The narratives which Abad painted to speak about contemporary art and culture in the Philippines were often located elsewhere. Immigration for her was an important issue but more so when she observed the US becoming more disturbed with a changing ‘multiethnic society of legal and illegal immigrants’. Her work was ‘multi-ethnic’ as it brought together experiences across cultures – Bangladesh to Sudan, Sudan to Jakarta, Jakarta to Boston, Washington DC to Manila, Yemen to Singapore – her creative trajectory dictated by her constantly shifting location … Importantly, she also referenced and painted a multiplicity of conditions which were not of her lived experience, but which, at the same time was the story of her life.(Joselina Cruz and Pio Abad, in Museum of Contemporary Art and Design 2018; unpaginated.) Two of the embroidered tapestries in Tate’s collection are from a series entitled Bacongo, referring to the Bantu ethnic group in Central Africa. The third, European Mask, speaks to Abad’s reversal of the co-opting of so-called primitive art by Western artists within the history of modern art. European Mask was installed as part of the work Metro Center Mural: Six Masks from Six Continents at a metro station in Washington D.C. from 1990–3. It was also included in the solo exhibition of the artist’s work at the Museum of Contemporary Art and Design in Manila in 2018, which focused on her trapunto works. The American artist Faith Ringgold (born 1930), who has also worked with quilted canvases, was taken by Abad’s trapunto works and authored a text on her work in the volume Fresh Talk/Daring Gazes: Conversations on Asian American Art edited by Elaine H. Kim, Margo Machida and Sharon Mizota (2003).

They are part of a series that Abad began in the late 1970s. Referring to them as trapuntos, from the Italian word for embroidery or quilt, these works are the artist’s responses to the cultural traditions that she encountered during her travels in Asia, Africa and Latin America, although they also refer to vernacular traditions of sewing – a traditional part of family education in the Philippines. They were made using large pieces of canvas onto which the artist stitched forms, creating a three-dimensional effect by stuffing the canvases and transforming their surface with paint, shells, buttons, beads, mirrors and other objects collected on her travels. Their decorated surfaces integrate a range of patterning techniques to create semi-figurative forms with what look like large eyes set in stylised, mask-like faces. Abad dispensed with stretcher bars and hung these works directly on the wall or from the ceiling and this, combined with the distinctive technique, transformed the relatively flat surface of a picture into something more multi-dimensional. The portability of the trapunto form can be said to resonate with the peripatetic aspect of a migrant existence as experienced by the artist, being an object that can theoretically be rolled up and more easily transported than a stretched painting. Inspired by her travels and interest in responding to cultural traditions in Indonesia, Bangladesh, Sudan, Philippines and elsewhere, Abad’s aim in her work was to connect with the world through a vibrant formal language that integrated her interest in traditional art forms such as batik painting in Indonesia, ink-brush painting in Korea, tie-dye in Africa and macramé in Papua New Guinea, all within a language of abstraction and figuration. Dismayed by Western-centric artistic styles while studying at the Corcoran School of Art in Washington D.C. in the mid-1970s, Abad became interested in social realism and also encountered works by the Mexican muralists Diego Rivera (1886–1957), David Siqueiros (1896–1974) and José Clemente Orozco (1883–1949) during a trip to Mexico in 1986. She sought to rejuvenate different artistic traditions and indigenous forms in order to respond to the social and political realities of communities she encountered, in particular refugees, immigrants and others at the margins of society. Of the artist’s motivations, the curators Joselina Cruz and Pio Abad have written: The narratives which Abad painted to speak about contemporary art and culture in the Philippines were often located elsewhere. Immigration for her was an important issue but more so when she observed the US becoming more disturbed with a changing ‘multiethnic society of legal and illegal immigrants’. Her work was ‘multi-ethnic’ as it brought together experiences across cultures – Bangladesh to Sudan, Sudan to Jakarta, Jakarta to Boston, Washington DC to Manila, Yemen to Singapore – her creative trajectory dictated by her constantly shifting location … Importantly, she also referenced and painted a multiplicity of conditions which were not of her lived experience, but which, at the same time was the story of her life.(Joselina Cruz and Pio Abad, in Museum of Contemporary Art and Design 2018, unpaginated.) Two of the embroidered tapestries in Tate’s collection are from a series entitled Bacongo, referring to the Bantu ethnic group in Central Africa. The third, European Mask, speaks to Abad’s reversal of the co-opting of so-called primitive art by Western artists within the history of modern art. European Mask was installed as part of the work Metro Center Mural: Six Masks from Six Continents at a metro station in Washington D.C. from 1990–3. It was also included in the solo exhibition of the artist’s work at the Museum of Contemporary Art and Design in Manila in 2018, which focused on her trapunto works. The American artist Faith Ringgold (born 1930), who has also worked with quilted canvases, was taken by Abad’s trapunto works and authored a text on her work in the volume Fresh Talk/Daring Gazes: Conversations on Asian American Art edited by Elaine H. Kim, Margo Machida and Sharon Mizota (2003).

Inspired by her travels and interest in responding to cultural traditions in Indonesia, Bangladesh, Sudan, Philippines and elsewhere, Abad’s aim in her work was to connect with the world through a vibrant formal language that integrated her interest in traditional art forms such as batik painting in Indonesia, ink-brush painting in Korea, tie-dye in Africa and macramé in Papua New Guinea, all within a language of abstraction and figuration. Dismayed by Western-centric artistic styles while studying at the Corcoran School of Art in Washington D.C. in the mid-1970s, Abad became interested in social realism and also encountered works by the Mexican muralists Diego Rivera (1886–1957), David Siqueiros (1896–1974) and José Clemente Orozco (1883–1949) during a trip to Mexico in 1986. She sought to rejuvenate different artistic traditions and indigenous forms in order to respond to the social and political realities of communities she encountered, in particular refugees, immigrants and others at the margins of society. Of the artist’s motivations, the curators Joselina Cruz and Pio Abad have written: The narratives which Abad painted to speak about contemporary art and culture in the Philippines were often located elsewhere. Immigration for her was an important issue but more so when she observed the US becoming more disturbed with a changing ‘multiethnic society of legal and illegal immigrants’. Her work was ‘multi-ethnic’ as it brought together experiences across cultures – Bangladesh to Sudan, Sudan to Jakarta, Jakarta to Boston, Washington DC to Manila, Yemen to Singapore – her creative trajectory dictated by her constantly shifting location … Importantly, she also referenced and painted a multiplicity of conditions which were not of her lived experience, but which, at the same time was the story of her life.(Joselina Cruz and Pio Abad, in Museum of Contemporary Art and Design 2018; unpaginated.) Two of the embroidered tapestries in Tate’s collection are from a series entitled Bacongo, referring to the Bantu ethnic group in Central Africa. The third, European Mask, speaks to Abad’s reversal of the co-opting of so-called primitive art by Western artists within the history of modern art. European Mask was installed as part of the work Metro Center Mural: Six Masks from Six Continents at a metro station in Washington D.C. from 1990–3. It was also included in the solo exhibition of the artist’s work at the Museum of Contemporary Art and Design in Manila in 2018, which focused on her trapunto works. The American artist Faith Ringgold (born 1930), who has also worked with quilted canvases, was taken by Abad’s trapunto works and authored a text on her work in the volume Fresh Talk/Daring Gazes: Conversations on Asian American Art edited by Elaine H. Kim, Margo Machida and Sharon Mizota (2003).

The video exists in an edition of five with two artist’s proofs; Tate’s copy is the second of the artist’s proofs. First performed at Hebbel am Ufer theatre in Berlin in 2000, the twenty-minute performance featured the artist in a short black dress and red high heels attempting to dance on twenty adjacent blocks of melting butter. In the video she enters the stage and carefully positions herself on the butter blocks, proceeding to dance using slow gesticulating movements inspired by traditional Indonesian dance, against the soundtrack of a percussive Indonesian drumbeat that usually accompanies Pakarena – a dance practice from South Sulawesi. During the performance, the artist slips and falls repeatedly, getting up again and again to continue the dance. Performed at a time when she was feeling alienated in her new home in Germany, the work draws on personal experience, using movement and the artist’s own body to explore the space between the viewer and the performer, as well as cross-cultural positions of the insider and the outsider. Suryodarmo has explained: Crossing the boundaries of cultural and political encounters has been a challenge that stimulates me discovering new identification. An effort to find identity is yet a dangerous act of losing the ground of origin. For me, the process of making artwork is a lifelong research that never stops me to put myself inside the metamorphic constellation. I intend to touch the fluid border between the body and its environment through my art works. I aim to create a concentrated level of intensity without the use of narrative structures. Talking about politics, society or psychology makes no sense to me if the nerves are not able to digest the information. (Quoted on artist’s website, http://www.melatisuryodarmo.com/about.html, accessed 12 June 2018.) A student of, and then assistant to, the performance artist Marina Abramovic (born 1946), Suryodarmo’s practice is in part informed by traditional Japanese Butoh dance and history following a chance encounter with the renowned Japanese Butoh dancer and choreographer Anzu Furukawa. Suryodarmo’s father was a practitioner of Amerta (a meditative, non-stylised movement practice) and her mother was a Javanese dancer. These multiple spheres of influence shape her ongoing research into the movements of the body and its relationship to the self and the world. Her work usually takes the form of durational performance documented in video, photography and installation. Often engaging in highly physical acts that involve repetitive movements and labour-intensive processes (such as grinding charcoal briskets in an exhibition hall for twelve hours in I am a Ghost in My Own House 2012), Suryadormo’s performances are non-verbal exchanges of intense engagement that build over time through her own physical output. Here the title ‘Exergie’ – the German form of ‘exergy’ – refers to a thermodynamics term that characterises a state of equilibrium by which maximum useful work is possible while bringing a system into equilibrium that retains heat. In such a state, energy is neither created nor destroyed. For Suryodarmo, it represents ‘a precious moment that can change, in which potential becomes energy’ (email correspondence with Tate curator Clara Kim, 12 June 2018). As with other works, Suryodarmo explores the transgressive nature of performance, subjecting the body – marked by physical difference, cultural specificity, political identity – to exercises of extreme labour, absurd acts and ritualistic movements that elicit empathy, compassion or transcendence. The curator and writer Eva McGovern-Basa has said of this particular work: The sounds of each fall and the anticipation of the next creates an electric tension for an audience that is both sympathetic and fascinated by the futility of her movement. The ‘factual absurdity’ of a woman dancing on butter is then transformed into a poetic action of the artist’s vulnerability … It acts as a form of resistance to larger forces and systems that attempt to subsume her, while allowing her to reflect on the temporary quality of life. (McGovern-Basa 2017, p.76.) Read through a feminist lens, Suryodarmo’s work follows a lineage of artists including Marina Abramovic, Mona Hatoum, Ana Mendieta and Yoko Ono who utilise their bodies to interrogate the dynamics of power, gender and identity, as well as personal and collective histories. The artist has performed this work on numerous occasions at performance festivals in Europe, Canada, Australia, Singapore and Brazil, as well as at Navigate – a festival of live art hosted by the Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art in Newcastle in 2005.

Each object takes the form of an item of ornate fine jewellery, such as a necklace a tiara or a brooch, and is presented on a brass stand according to the display convention of decorative arts museums. Beneath each object is a brief printed description of the item and, in a subversion of traditional museum practices, the equivalent value of the jewellery in public goods and services. For example, in the first two descriptions, ‘A Belle Epoque diamond and platinum tiara, by Cartier’ is equated to ‘The treatment of 12,052 cases of tuberculosis until their full recovery’ and ‘An antique Ceylon sapphire and diamond necklace, by Van Cleef & Arpels’ is equated to ' Electricity to approximately 2,252 households in off-grid area’. The work is accompanied by interpretive texts situated in the gallery, explaining that the objects are replicas of lots in the ‘Hawaii Collection’, a 2016 cancelled auction sale of jewellery that had been seized by United States customs from the deposed leaders of the Philippines, Imelda and Ferdinand Marcos, when they landed in Honolulu, after being granted exile in 1986 by then US President Ronald Reagan. The subject is of particular interest to Abad, whose immediate family were prominent critics of the Marcos dictatorship, to the degree that both of his parents were incarcerated under that regime. The work comments on power, corruption and the ownership of material objects. Jane Ryan and William Saunders were the pseudonyms adopted by Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos in 1968 to set up a Swiss bank account that notoriously became a depository for funds diverted from the Philippine treasury for their private benefit. In Abad and Wadsworth Jones’s ‘collection’, ‘the jewels exist not as luxurious accessories but as a spectral line-up that hovers between evidence and effigy, carrying with it the painful history of a nation’ (artists’ statement, correspondence with Tate curators Clara Kim and Katy Wan, June 2020). The Collection of Jane Ryan & William Saunders is a collaborative work between Pio Abad and his wife, the jewellery designer Frances Wadsworth Jones, whose involvement reveals the technical knowledge and skill required to reconstruct the ‘Hawaii Collection’, for which the artists were only able to access documentary photographs from the cancelled Christie’s auction sale. The work exists in an edition of two with one artists’ proof; Tate’s is the artists’ proof. It was exhibited at Art Jameel in Dubai in 2019–20. This work forms part of a long-term artistic project started by Pio Abad in 2012 on the significance of certain artefacts in the recent history of the Philippines, with particular attention given to the cultural legacy of the Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos regime. Curator Natasha Ginwala has described Abad’s historical investigations as ‘revealing large consequences of … loot as an unauthenticated history, eerily echoing feudal patterns and the generational spread of oligarchic power in the present day.’ (Natasha Ginwala, ‘Corruption: Three Bodies, and Ungovernable Subjects’, e-flux journal, no.67, November 2015, https://www.e-flux.com/journal/67/60724/corruption-three-bodies-and-ungovernable-subjects/, accessed 12 August 2020.)

When Gordine held an exhibition of her work in London in 1938, she was praised by poet and critic Arthur Symons: ‘Her profound sense of pure form in sculpture, heedless alike of realism and of exaggerated abstraction, is united with the subtlest delicacy of modelling, and these qualities endow her bronzes with abnormal power.’ This work was bequeathed to Tate by Symons’ wife, Rhoda. Dora Gordine was born in St. Petersburg in 1906 and died in London in 1991.",1.0,1.0,,,,Malaysian,

Five are photogravures depicting trees. The other five are soft ground etching and aquatint on paper; these images are abstract and have a smaller plate size than the photogravures. The prints were produced at Druckatelier Kurt Zein in Vienna, where the artist lives and works. They were published in an edition of thirty-five with ten artist’s and publisher’s proofs; Tate owns number eleven in the edition. Federle has travelled extensively and for many years has taken photographs of trees during his international journeys. The photographs used in this portfolio were taken on four continents and depict large trees in diverse landscapes. The images are taken from a low viewpoint and cropped so that the tops of the depicted trees are not visible. Federle highlights the structural forms of the trunks and branches, and emphasises the connection between the trees and the ground. The photographic prints are reproduced in a deep blue. Although the source photographs were taken in daylight, the colouration gives the prints a contemplative, nocturnal quality. Federle is known predominantly as a painter (see Norwegian Sight, 1997, Tate T07463). He uses simple geometric forms including segments of the letters of the alphabet as the basis for compositions made with delicate painterly brushstrokes. The etchings in this portfolio are structurally similar to paintings made by the artist in the late 1990s and early twenty-first century in which Federle used a repeated motif of vertical bands. Like the photogravures, the etchings are printed using the artist’s characteristically limited palette. Rather than the deep blue of the representational prints, the abstract etchings are made in a darker blue-grey; the images become progressively looser and less rigidly structured. Federle seeks to convey a sense of spirituality approaching the sublime in his depiction of simple forms and the natural world. He has averred that ‘it can only be the spiritual which satisfies in art’ (quoted in Eva Badura-Triska, ‘1/1, 1/2, 1/4 (to Johannes Itten)’, Helmut Federle 5+1, p.20). The two styles deployed in Blue Sisters suggest contrasting and complementary contemporary approaches to the Romantic. The photogravures are depictions of landscape in the tradition of German Romantic painters including Caspar David Friedrich (1774-1840) while the etchings show the influence of American Abstract Expressionist artists, particularly Mark Rothko (1903-70; see Black on Maroon, 1958, Tate T01166). Speaking about an earlier series, Federle said, ‘I ... handle the abstract vocabulary with the same emotionality and the same symbolization as if I would paint a landscape’ (quoted in Badura-Triska, p.21). The source photograph for this print was taken by the artist in Pindaya, Myanmar (formally Burma) in 1998. It depicts the base of a dead or dying tree, closely cropped so that it dominates almost the entire picture area. Small sections of sky and the leafy branches of other trees are only visible on the left side of the image and in the top right hand corner. The cracked ends of the dead tree’s branches and the blue tint of the photogravure lend an eerie quality, making the tree appear fossilised. Small plants grow up and around the roots, suggesting the potential for renewed growth.

The source photograph for this print was taken by the artist in Pindaya, Myanmar (formally Burma) in 1998. It depicts the base of a dead or dying tree, closely cropped so that it dominates almost the entire picture area. Small sections of sky and the leafy branches of other trees are only visible on the left side of the image and in the top right hand corner. The cracked ends of the dead tree’s branches and the blue tint of the photogravure lend an eerie quality, making the tree appear fossilised. Small plants grow up and around the roots, suggesting the potential for renewed growth.

Five are photogravures depicting trees. The other five are soft ground etching and aquatint on paper; these images are abstract and have a smaller plate size than the photogravures. The prints were produced at Druckatelier Kurt Zein in Vienna, where the artist lives and works. They were published in an edition of thirty-five with ten artist’s and publisher’s proofs; Tate owns number eleven in the edition. Federle has travelled extensively and for many years has taken photographs of trees during his international journeys. The photographs used in this portfolio were taken on four continents and depict large trees in diverse landscapes. The images are taken from a low viewpoint and cropped so that the tops of the depicted trees are not visible. Federle highlights the structural forms of the trunks and branches, and emphasises the connection between the trees and the ground. The photographic prints are reproduced in a deep blue. Although the source photographs were taken in daylight, the colouration gives the prints a contemplative, nocturnal quality. Federle is known predominantly as a painter (see Norwegian Sight, 1997, Tate T07463). He uses simple geometric forms including segments of the letters of the alphabet as the basis for compositions made with delicate painterly brushstrokes. The etchings in this portfolio are structurally similar to paintings made by the artist in the late 1990s and early twenty-first century in which Federle used a repeated motif of vertical bands. Like the photogravures, the etchings are printed using the artist’s characteristically limited palette. Rather than the deep blue of the representational prints, the abstract etchings are made in a darker blue-grey; the images become progressively looser and less rigidly structured. Federle seeks to convey a sense of spirituality approaching the sublime in his depiction of simple forms and the natural world. He has averred that ‘it can only be the spiritual which satisfies in art’ (quoted in Eva Badura-Triska, ‘1/1, 1/2, 1/4 (to Johannes Itten)’, Helmut Federle 5+1, p.20). The two styles deployed in Blue Sisters suggest contrasting and complementary contemporary approaches to the Romantic. The photogravures are depictions of landscape in the tradition of German Romantic painters including Caspar David Friedrich (1774-1840) while the etchings show the influence of American Abstract Expressionist artists, particularly Mark Rothko (1903-70; see Black on Maroon, 1958, Tate T01166). Speaking about an earlier series, Federle said, ‘I ... handle the abstract vocabulary with the same emotionality and the same symbolization as if I would paint a landscape’ (quoted in Badura-Triska, p.21). The source photograph for this print was taken by the artist at Angkor Wat in Cambodia in 1994. This extraordinary image shows a tree growing around a partially ruined Hindu temple. Although the temple is crumbling, its ornate decorative features are still intact. The façade is carved stone and statues of deities are visible in niches. The tree appears to have grown next to one side of the temple, leaning into and finally wrapping itself as it grew around the walls and roof of the building. Roots drape unexpectedly over broken roof tiles. Federle has long-standing interests in ancient cultures and Eastern philosophy. In this image those concerns are combined with a Romantic vision of nature reclaiming human creation.

Five are photogravures depicting trees. The other five are soft ground etching and aquatint on paper; these images are abstract and have a smaller plate size than the photogravures. The prints were produced at Druckatelier Kurt Zein in Vienna, where the artist lives and works. They were published in an edition of thirty-five with ten artist’s and publisher’s proofs; Tate owns number eleven in the edition. Federle has travelled extensively and for many years has taken photographs of trees during his international journeys. The photographs used in this portfolio were taken on four continents and depict large trees in diverse landscapes. The images are taken from a low viewpoint and cropped so that the tops of the depicted trees are not visible. Federle highlights the structural forms of the trunks and branches, and emphasises the connection between the trees and the ground. The photographic prints are reproduced in a deep blue. Although the source photographs were taken in daylight, the colouration gives the prints a contemplative, nocturnal quality. Federle is known predominantly as a painter (see Norwegian Sight, 1997, Tate T07463). He uses simple geometric forms including segments of the letters of the alphabet as the basis for compositions made with delicate painterly brushstrokes. The etchings in this portfolio are structurally similar to paintings made by the artist in the late 1990s and early twenty-first century in which Federle used a repeated motif of vertical bands. Like the photogravures, the etchings are printed using the artist’s characteristically limited palette. Rather than the deep blue of the representational prints, the abstract etchings are made in a darker blue-grey; the images become progressively looser and less rigidly structured. Federle seeks to convey a sense of spirituality approaching the sublime in his depiction of simple forms and the natural world. He has averred that ‘it can only be the spiritual which satisfies in art’ (quoted in Eva Badura-Triska, ‘1/1, 1/2, 1/4 (to Johannes Itten)’, Helmut Federle 5+1, p.20). The two styles deployed in Blue Sisters suggest contrasting and complementary contemporary approaches to the Romantic. The photogravures are depictions of landscape in the tradition of German Romantic painters including Caspar David Friedrich (1774-1840) while the etchings show the influence of American Abstract Expressionist artists, particularly Mark Rothko (1903-70; see Black on Maroon, 1958, Tate T01166). Speaking about an earlier series, Federle said, ‘I ... handle the abstract vocabulary with the same emotionality and the same symbolization as if I would paint a landscape’ (quoted in Badura-Triska, p.21). The source photograph for this print was taken by the artist at Angkor Wat in Cambodia in 1994. This extraordinary image shows a tree growing around a partially ruined Hindu temple. Although the temple is crumbling, its ornate decorative features are still intact. The façade is carved stone and statues of deities are visible in niches. The tree appears to have grown next to one side of the temple, leaning into and finally wrapping itself as it grew around the walls and roof of the building. Roots drape unexpectedly over broken roof tiles. Federle has long-standing interests in ancient cultures and Eastern philosophy. In this image those concerns are combined with a Romantic vision of nature reclaiming human creation.

It belongs to a series of three large-scale works on the subject of the Vietnam War the artist made between 1972 and 1974. The paintings were motivated in part by the American presidential election of 1972, which saw Richard Nixon (1913-94) soundly defeating the anti-war platform of George McGovern (born 1922). Golub had adopted an active stance against the Vietnam conflict for almost a decade at the time these works were made; he joined the anti-war group Artists and Writers Protest on his return to the United States in 1964 after living for several years in Europe. However until this series he had not directly addressed contemporary issues in his work. The Vietnam paintings marked a move in Golub’s work from more ambiguous, classically inspired images of masculinity and power (see Fighter, 1965, Tate P77249) to a more pointed and abrasive political engagement with subject matter which has continued in his work to the present day. The composition of Vietnam II is polarised. On the left side of the painting are three uniformed American soldiers in front of an armoured car. All three men brandish machine guns, two of which are pointed towards a group of Vietnamese men, women and children huddled on the far right of the image. Behind the civilians are what appears to be the charred remains of a makeshift building; wooden posts and bits of corrugated iron are covered in a thin, sooty wash of paint. A large expanse of bare canvas divides the two groups of figures. The aggression on the faces of the American soldiers is countered by the combination of horror and stoicism in the expressions of the Vietnamese figures, particularly a young boy positioned in the foreground of the image whose face acts as the focal point for the right side of the composition. He stares directly out of the picture, implicating the viewer in the action. The dynamic postures of the figures were sourced from contemporary news photographs. Golub has described his working process, saying, ‘I begin by projecting drawings or parts of photographs onto the canvas – each figure is a synthesis of different sources ... I want each figure to be both the reconstruction of a generic type and to possess an idiosyncratic singular existence. The figures are first outlined and shaded in black. The second coat emphasizes three dimensionality and designated highlights. I apply local colour to define skin, wood, metal, cloth. The canvas is put on the floor and paint areas are dissolved with solvent and scraped. The main scraping tool is a meat cleaver. Once the canvas has been scraped down, eroded – a process which frequently takes two weeks – I reconstruct the figures’ (quoted in Michael Newman, ‘Interview with Leon Golub’, Leon Golub: Mercenaries and Interrogations, pp.5-6). The process of scraping embeds areas of colour deep in the grain of the support and gives the surface of the painting a rough texture. The painting is executed on unstretched linen, and hangs directly on the wall from grommets positioned at regular intervals along the top of the canvas. Hanging loosely in this manner, the painting is suggestive of an unfurled banner or an animal hide. Along the bottom edge, three irregular forms have been cut away from the painting. These jagged excisions echo the violence depicted in the image in an assault on the fabric of the artwork. Golub originally planned to give the Vietnam paintings the collective title Assassins. In re-naming the paintings he not only situated the depicted conflict in a specific time and place but acknowledged the complexities and moral ambiguities of warfare, suggesting that soldiers ordered to fight in an unjust war are subject to a similar experience of de-humanisation as the civilians who are caught in their crossfire. Writer and curator Jon Bird has elaborated this point, saying, ‘Unlike traditional history painting, in which the historical referent frames and conditions the viewer’s understanding, Golub’s historical project is closer to that of Goya ... whose political “message” problematizes historical responsibility’ (Bird, p.57). Francisco de Goya (1746-1828) is a frequently cited influence on Golub, and the structure of Vietnam II has been compared to Goya’s indictment of the Napoleonic invasion of Spain, Third of May 1808, 1814 (Museo del Prado, Madrid).

It belongs to a series of three large-scale works on the subject of the Vietnam War the artist made between 1972 and 1974. The paintings were motivated in part by the American presidential election of 1972, which saw Richard Nixon (1913-94) soundly defeating the anti-war platform of George McGovern (born 1922). Golub had adopted an active stance against the Vietnam conflict for almost a decade at the time these works were made; he joined the anti-war group Artists and Writers Protest on his return to the United States in 1964 after living for several years in Europe. However until this series he had not directly addressed contemporary issues in his work. The Vietnam paintings marked a move in Golub’s work from more ambiguous, classically inspired images of masculinity and power (see Fighter, 1965, Tate P77249) to a more pointed and abrasive political engagement with subject matter which has continued in his work to the present day. The composition of Vietnam II is polarised. On the left side of the painting are three uniformed American soldiers in front of an armoured car. All three men brandish machine guns, two of which are pointed towards a group of Vietnamese men, women and children huddled on the far right of the image. Behind the civilians are what appears to be the charred remains of a makeshift building; wooden posts and bits of corrugated iron are covered in a thin, sooty wash of paint. A large expanse of bare canvas divides the two groups of figures. The aggression on the faces of the American soldiers is countered by the combination of horror and stoicism in the expressions of the Vietnamese figures, particularly a young boy positioned in the foreground of the image whose face acts as the focal point for the right side of the composition. He stares directly out of the picture, implicating the viewer in the action. The dynamic postures of the figures were sourced from contemporary news photographs. Golub has described his working process, saying, ‘I begin by projecting drawings or parts of photographs onto the canvas – each figure is a synthesis of different sources ... I want each figure to be both the reconstruction of a generic type and to possess an idiosyncratic singular existence. The figures are first outlined and shaded in black. The second coat emphasizes three dimensionality and designated highlights. I apply local colour to define skin, wood, metal, cloth. The canvas is put on the floor and paint areas are dissolved with solvent and scraped. The main scraping tool is a meat cleaver. Once the canvas has been scraped down, eroded – a process which frequently takes two weeks – I reconstruct the figures’ (quoted in Michael Newman, ‘Interview with Leon Golub’, Leon Golub: Mercenaries and Interrogations, pp.5-6). The process of scraping embeds areas of colour deep in the grain of the support and gives the surface of the painting a rough texture. The painting is executed on unstretched linen, and hangs directly on the wall from grommets positioned at regular intervals along the top of the canvas. Hanging loosely in this manner, the painting is suggestive of an unfurled banner or an animal hide. Along the bottom edge, three irregular forms have been cut away from the painting. These jagged excisions echo the violence depicted in the image in an assault on the fabric of the artwork. Golub originally planned to give the Vietnam paintings the collective title Assassins. In re-naming the paintings he not only situated the depicted conflict in a specific time and place but acknowledged the complexities and moral ambiguities of warfare, suggesting that soldiers ordered to fight in an unjust war are subject to a similar experience of de-humanisation as the civilians who are caught in their crossfire. Writer and curator Jon Bird has elaborated this point, saying, ‘Unlike traditional history painting, in which the historical referent frames and conditions the viewer’s understanding, Golub’s historical project is closer to that of Goya ... whose political “message” problematizes historical responsibility’ (Bird, p.57). Francisco de Goya (1746-1828) is a frequently cited influence on Golub, and the structure of Vietnam II has been compared to Goya’s indictment of the Napoleonic invasion of Spain, Third of May 1808, 1814 (Museo del Prado, Madrid).

It belongs to a series of three large-scale works on the subject of the Vietnam War the artist made between 1972 and 1974. The paintings were motivated in part by the American presidential election of 1972, which saw Richard Nixon (1913-94) soundly defeating the anti-war platform of George McGovern (born 1922). Golub had adopted an active stance against the Vietnam conflict for almost a decade at the time these works were made; he joined the anti-war group Artists and Writers Protest on his return to the United States in 1964 after living for several years in Europe. However until this series he had not directly addressed contemporary issues in his work. The Vietnam paintings marked a move in Golub’s work from more ambiguous, classically inspired images of masculinity and power (see Fighter, 1965, Tate P77249) to a more pointed and abrasive political engagement with subject matter which has continued in his work to the present day. The composition of Vietnam II is polarised. On the left side of the painting are three uniformed American soldiers in front of an armoured car. All three men brandish machine guns, two of which are pointed towards a group of Vietnamese men, women and children huddled on the far right of the image. Behind the civilians are what appears to be the charred remains of a makeshift building; wooden posts and bits of corrugated iron are covered in a thin, sooty wash of paint. A large expanse of bare canvas divides the two groups of figures. The aggression on the faces of the American soldiers is countered by the combination of horror and stoicism in the expressions of the Vietnamese figures, particularly a young boy positioned in the foreground of the image whose face acts as the focal point for the right side of the composition. He stares directly out of the picture, implicating the viewer in the action. The dynamic postures of the figures were sourced from contemporary news photographs. Golub has described his working process, saying, ‘I begin by projecting drawings or parts of photographs onto the canvas – each figure is a synthesis of different sources ... I want each figure to be both the reconstruction of a generic type and to possess an idiosyncratic singular existence. The figures are first outlined and shaded in black. The second coat emphasizes three dimensionality and designated highlights. I apply local colour to define skin, wood, metal, cloth. The canvas is put on the floor and paint areas are dissolved with solvent and scraped. The main scraping tool is a meat cleaver. Once the canvas has been scraped down, eroded – a process which frequently takes two weeks – I reconstruct the figures’ (quoted in Michael Newman, ‘Interview with Leon Golub’, Leon Golub: Mercenaries and Interrogations, pp.5-6). The process of scraping embeds areas of colour deep in the grain of the support and gives the surface of the painting a rough texture. The painting is executed on unstretched linen, and hangs directly on the wall from grommets positioned at regular intervals along the top of the canvas. Hanging loosely in this manner, the painting is suggestive of an unfurled banner or an animal hide. Along the bottom edge, three irregular forms have been cut away from the painting. These jagged excisions echo the violence depicted in the image in an assault on the fabric of the artwork. Golub originally planned to give the Vietnam paintings the collective title Assassins. In re-naming the paintings he not only situated the depicted conflict in a specific time and place but acknowledged the complexities and moral ambiguities of warfare, suggesting that soldiers ordered to fight in an unjust war are subject to a similar experience of de-humanisation as the civilians who are caught in their crossfire.

He had opposed the war since the 1960s but avoided representing it directly in his work, preferring to explore the themes of masculinity and power in a more universal manner. He changed his mind after the 1972 presidential election, in which the anti-war Senator George McGovern was heavily defeated by Richard Nixon. Golub used news photographs and his own experience as a veteran of the Second World War in order to build an allegory of the disconnection generated by conflict. Vietnam II sets American soldiers and their armoured car across a telling central gulf from Vietnamese civilian victims. The contrast between ruthless organisation and panicked disintegration find an echo in the apparently fragmentary nature of the work itself.",1.0,1.0,,,,Vietnamese,

It consists of seven videos of differing durations in which the history of the border town of Nabua, in northeast Thailand, is re-imagined as an elusive science fiction ghost story rooted in Thai folklore. The work comprises eight projections, since one of the videos, Primitive which gives the work its name, is shown on two synchronised screens. The seven videos are: Primitive (duration 29 minutes 34 seconds), Nabua (duration 9 minutes 11 seconds), Making of the Spaceship (duration 28 minutes 13 seconds), A Dedicated Machine (duration 1 minute), An Evening Shoot (duration 4 minutes 10 seconds), I'm Still Breathing (music video, duration 11 minutes) and Nabua Song (music video, duration 4 minutes 12 seconds). Nabua, situated where the Mekong River divides Thailand from Laos, was historically the scene of considerable racial strife and violence. From the 1960s until the early 1980s it was a ‘red zone’ where the Mao-influenced Communists hid in the jungle. The Thai army curbed the communist insurgent farmers through physical and psychological abuse and murder. The town also harbours an ancient legend about a widow ghost who would abduct any man who entered her empire, earning it the nickname ‘widow town’. Weerasethakul transforms the town into one of men, the teenage male descendants of the farmer communists, freed from the widow ghost’s empire. These teenagers fabricate their own memories and build a new world, manufacturing a spaceship in the ricefields. For Weerasethakul the jungle is a place of darkness and mystery, in which distinctions between the fictional and the real dissolve. It is a parallel world, populated by enchanted spectres, where mystery and emotion mingle in shadow. The jungle forms a perfect stage for the artist’s fascination with reincarnation, transformation and light. Curator James Quandt has commented that Weerasethakul’s work turns ‘everyday objects and images into the ineffable and enigmatic, inhabitants of a phantom zone where the hard, “real” world of cars and bodies and buildings cedes dominion to a magical realm of reverie and desire’ (Österreichisches Filmmuseum and SYNEMA – Gesellschaft für Film und Medien 2009). The artist has stated that Primitive is ‘a reincarnation of presence (and absence). It’s also a reincarnation of cinema as a means of transportation as it was in the time of the early cinema innovator Georges Méliès: the ‘motion picture’ carries us from our own world. Primitive is a meditation on those voyages in fabulous vehicles that bring about the transformation of people and of light’ (unpublished artist’s statement, September 2008). Inspired in part by surrealism, Weerasethakul’s films present a world that is distinctly mutable and elusive, evoking the artist’s interest in the surrealist game Exquisite Corpse, whereby players add words or images sequentially to a sentence or diagram without knowing what came before, so as to construct a fanciful, multi-layered scenario. Conventional narrative unravels as storylines change course and genre morphs from fiction to fantasy to documentary. Drawing heavily on anecdotal traditions from rural Thai villagers, as well as personal politics, social issues and his own early fascination with science fiction, Weerasethakul crafts a unique approach to history which is seemingly caught in an endless cycle of dreams.

In his work ‘the quality and character of the marble, wood, or stone [played] a great part in the conception and in the finish of the subject carved’.[3] In this respect, the rounded forms of Burmese Dancer demonstrated the relative softness of the alabaster, which, as a result, was ‘not usually ... used for carving of great fineness and precision’.[4] With the exception of the deep cutting around the neck and arms, the mass of the block was largely maintained; as seen in the flat back of the figure’s legs. The circular dimple in the upper lip appears to have been drilled, and the face was generally quite crudely cut. A number of blemishes - particularly those on the left side of the head - were filled with plaster or putty. The four curves in the front of the skirt anticipate the use of incised line by both Skeaping and Hepworth over the following years. The choice of a creamy alabaster for Burmese Dancer allowed for a natural translucence. Skeaping worked with the pinkish veins, the most noticeable of which runs through the right side of the head, right breast and leg, and down the centre of the back.

The overall effect is of an undulating translucent field where the light glows amidst the rice. As with many of Phaophanit’s works, light plays an important role in this installation, binding together the different materials to achieve a particular visual effect. In addition to the work’s visual impact, the rice also generates its own particular smell, which pervades the space beyond the physical limits of the piece. For the artist, Neon Rice Field relies on the ‘interactions of the materials’ (quoted in Tate Gallery 1993, [p.6]) and brings together two utterly disparate things, one natural and organic and the other manufactured and industrial. These materials carry cultural associations that have often been inscribed within the dichotomy between the Western and the Eastern worlds (in this instance, of industry versus agriculture). However, the cultural allegiances that might be attached to them are more complex, more problematic and more fluid than any dualistic reading allows for. Phaophanit often infuses into his work a discreet subversion of the narratives attached to the materials and, while rice is unequivocally a symbol for the East, he has in the past used American sponsorship to supply the rice to stage his work. Likewise, the presence of neon which could sometimes be assumed to represent the western city is also a feature of many Asian cities. Unwilling to attach any predetermined meanings to the work, Phaophanit is concerned with the potential for ‘possibilities of meanings’, and he considers that the materials and their juxtapositions carry their own significance while, at the same time, they open the way to new associations. ‘Once you name all the meanings,’ he has said, ‘something still remains, something left over. That’s how I work. For instance, I use rice not only as a material, a substance, a smell or a symbol of food in the East, but I want to shake things – see what falls down.’ (Quoted in Irish Museum of Modern Art 1997, p. 96.) Born in Laos and educated in France, Phaophanit settled in England in 1985. In 1990 he began to incorporate in his work materials such as rice, rubber and bamboo, which are largely produced in South East Asia and have economic, cultural and historical significance. However, Phaophanit has always opposed any readings of his work that reduce it to a reflection on his cultural identity: Such biographical discourse is very limiting when it comes to talking about the work itself. I don’t only make my work as I do simply because I’m a refugee. It’s also concerned with the way I’m living at the moment. I don’t want to be categorised. I don’t want to be ‘French’ or ‘English’. And I don’t want to be ‘Laotian’.(Vong Phaophanit interviewed by Jonathan Watkins, in Vong Phaophanit: What Falls to the Ground but Can’t be Eaten, exhibition catalogue, Chisenhale Gallery, London 1991, unpaginated.) Neon Rice Field was first exhibited at the Serpentine Gallery, London in 1993 and later the same year at the Aperto section of the 45th Venice Biennale. It was subsequently shown as Phaophanit’s contribution to the Turner Prize at the Tate Gallery, London in 1993. Over the years, it has been shown in different configurations but always incorporating seven tons of white rice spread over six lines of neon lights.

It belongs to a series of three large-scale works on the subject of the Vietnam War the artist made between 1972 and 1974. The paintings were motivated in part by the American presidential election of 1972, which saw Richard Nixon (1913-94) soundly defeating the anti-war platform of George McGovern (born 1922). Golub had adopted an active stance against the Vietnam conflict for almost a decade at the time these works were made; he joined the anti-war group Artists and Writers Protest on his return to the United States in 1964 after living for several years in Europe. However until this series he had not directly addressed contemporary issues in his work. The Vietnam paintings marked a move in Golub’s work from more ambiguous, classically inspired images of masculinity and power (see Fighter, 1965, Tate P77249) to a more pointed and abrasive political engagement with subject matter which has continued in his work to the present day. The composition of Vietnam II is polarised. On the left side of the painting are three uniformed American soldiers in front of an armoured car. All three men brandish machine guns, two of which are pointed towards a group of Vietnamese men, women and children huddled on the far right of the image. Behind the civilians are what appears to be the charred remains of a makeshift building; wooden posts and bits of corrugated iron are covered in a thin, sooty wash of paint. A large expanse of bare canvas divides the two groups of figures. The aggression on the faces of the American soldiers is countered by the combination of horror and stoicism in the expressions of the Vietnamese figures, particularly a young boy positioned in the foreground of the image whose face acts as the focal point for the right side of the composition. He stares directly out of the picture, implicating the viewer in the action. The dynamic postures of the figures were sourced from contemporary news photographs. Golub has described his working process, saying, ‘I begin by projecting drawings or parts of photographs onto the canvas – each figure is a synthesis of different sources ... I want each figure to be both the reconstruction of a generic type and to possess an idiosyncratic singular existence. The figures are first outlined and shaded in black. The second coat emphasizes three dimensionality and designated highlights. I apply local colour to define skin, wood, metal, cloth. The canvas is put on the floor and paint areas are dissolved with solvent and scraped. The main scraping tool is a meat cleaver. Once the canvas has been scraped down, eroded – a process which frequently takes two weeks – I reconstruct the figures’ (quoted in Michael Newman, ‘Interview with Leon Golub’, Leon Golub: Mercenaries and Interrogations, pp.5-6). The process of scraping embeds areas of colour deep in the grain of the support and gives the surface of the painting a rough texture. The painting is executed on unstretched linen, and hangs directly on the wall from grommets positioned at regular intervals along the top of the canvas. Hanging loosely in this manner, the painting is suggestive of an unfurled banner or an animal hide. Along the bottom edge, three irregular forms have been cut away from the painting. These jagged excisions echo the violence depicted in the image in an assault on the fabric of the artwork. Golub originally planned to give the Vietnam paintings the collective title Assassins. In re-naming the paintings he not only situated the depicted conflict in a specific time and place but acknowledged the complexities and moral ambiguities of warfare, suggesting that soldiers ordered to fight in an unjust war are subject to a similar experience of de-humanisatio",1.0,1.0,,,,,Vietnam

The subject of male combatants has dominated Golub's work since the late 1950s. This particular pose is seen again in ‘Gigantomachy II’, 1966 (the artist, repr., Donald Kuspit, Leon Golub: Existentialist/Activist Painter, New Brunswick 1985, p.135, pls.89–90), one of a series of paintings Golub made between 1965 and 1967 depicting nude males in combat. It is possible that the artist began this painting in 1965, near to the time he made P77249. The reddish tone of the figure in the lithograph, which can be seen as symbolic of vigour, appears to have been carried through into the predominantly red colouration of the figure in the painting. In conversation on 2 November 1988, Golub commented that his fighter images display conflicting traits, reflecting his own ambivalence towards the subject. The fighter in P77249 is, he said, ‘quite heroic in his gestures, the arm is lifted above his head. This gesture is one of alertness and valour’. He continued, ‘my work is continuously between two poles - between aggression and a certain kind of heroism. But it is a heroism which is existential, because [the fighters] can never get out of their fix’. He said that the large scale of the ‘Gigantomachy’ paintings emphasised the heroic nature of the imagery, and that he had intended the ‘Gigantomachy’ series to be viewed from a distance, like Greek temple pediments. The warriors in Golub's paintings of the late 1950s were inspired by ancient Greek sculpture. The artist explained that in this period he was searching for an objective source of imagery, in which the structure of the body was not exaggerated or stylised in a ‘primitivistic manner’. In the early 1970s he began using contemporary magazine and newspaper photographs as sources for his images of soldiers. He aimed to depict current conflicts, and to register his political opposition to the destructive results of military intervention.

Kuspit 1985, p.128, pl.79), which depicts two warriors clashing. P77249 was produced at the Tamarind Lithography Workshop in Los Angeles, California, where Golub worked for six weeks during the summer of 1965. Golub said that he blurred the contours of the figure by erasing and redrawing the lines, in an attempt to capture the effect of a figure in motion. This style of drawing emphasised the figure's vitality and energy. The artist has approved this entry.
