Kngwarreye was an Anmatyerre Elder. Her artwork focuses on the area where she lived - Alhalkere country, in the Utopia region of the Northern Territory. The dots and lines in her work often represent the vegetation, animals and landscape of the country, and relate to the Anmatyerre Creation Stories. Untitled (Alhalkere) is one of Kngwarreye’s earliest works using acrylic paint on canvas. She began painting with acrylic in late 1988, when she was already in her seventies. She had previously worked in batik, which is a wax-resist dyeing method originating in Indonesia.

With his seminal work, A Line Made By Walking 1967 (Tate P07149) – a photograph showing a straight line worn in a field of grass by the repeated movement of the artist’s feet over it – Long established the simple act of walking as a gesture of primordial mark-making fundamental to the creation of art. In the context of late 1960s conceptualism, Long’s act may be seen as a subversion of the traditionally expressive gesture central to painting. Walking is non-expressive, a mechanical movement which permits the body to travel from one point to another. In a similar way, the line joining one point to another is fundamental to the process of drawing – the logical means of connection on which cartography is based. Lines imposed on the environment are usually the result of processes of measuring, map-making and creating roads and are forced by the contours of the earth’s surface to compromise the ideal logic of straightness. Unlike lines on paper, they have to exist in three dimensions, taking on a physicality of their own and appearing different depending on where they are viewed from. They become sculptural forms.

In the 1970s Long extended his process of making transient marks on the landscape to include another primordial human activity: the collection and organisation of raw materials found within the environment. Over the decades he has extended the straight line to encompass the cross, the square, the circle, the spiral, concentric rings, parallel lines, the crooked line, the heap, the dribble, the scratch; every possible means of making marks in nature with what is to hand, using simple actions with the artist’s hands or feet, is covered in Long’s oeuvre. He has covered many different kinds of terrain, walking extensively in England, particularly in the south west around Bristol, which is his home, and travelling to far off, deserted and spectacular wild landscapes. 
 
The results of Long’s actions may be brought into the gallery and laid out on the floor, resulting in a sculptural work, or they are photographed in situ, resulting in a picture. A Line in the Himalayas is one of several photographs resulting from a walk Long undertook in the Nepalese Himalayas in 1975. It shows a rough rocky terrain and snow-covered jagged peaks – a harsh, barren landscape typical to places of high altitude. The sky is a deep, clear blue, tinting the snow and the white rocks. Beginning in the foreground and disappearing into the chaotic texture of dark mountain scree to the side of the image, a narrow raised line of white stones lies almost straight on the landscape. With no human or animal presence of any kind, it is hard to gauge the scale of the stones and rocky outcrops which appear to encompass a great distance: between the foreground and the mountains in the far distance there is no middle ground. 

Long photographed this line of stones twice. Another version of A Line in the Himalayas 1975 (Sanders Collection, Amsterdam) is a black and white photograph centred on the line. Beginning with a small lump of ice, it bisects the image dramatically. In the colour version, the line is more subtle, appearing almost incidental. Both images are unique prints.

This is one of several scenes Branson painted while living in Battersea during the Second World War. The juxaposition of scales and perspectives in this painting blend surrealism and modern realism to create a striking visual intensity. The contrasting details, such as the local British-Nazi propaganda graffiti beneath a government sponsored ‘Dig for Victory’ poster, convey conflicting ideologies in British society of which he would have been conscious as a member of the Communist Party. Branson later joined the Royal Armoured Corps and died on active service in Burma in 1944.

Branson was then living in Battersea where he would have witnessed at first hand the devastating air raids. In this painting he employs surrealistic juxtapositions and unusual perspectives to imbue the painting with a startling visual intensity, while at the same time giving an overt critique of the war. The determined face of the woman on the left, (possibly a portrait of the artist’s wife, Noreen Branson, interview with Rosa Branson, 5 November 2004) rescuing some of her possessions from the scene of the recent attack confronts the viewer whose attention is also drawn towards the dramatically foreshortened chair, empty cigarette packet and striped barrier. The sky, filled with barrage balloons to prevent bombing by the Luftwaffe, is lit up by two searchlights which make an aggressive pattern over a factory. The ‘Dig for Victory’ poster on the right hand side, which shows a man working a spade into the earth, refers to a Government campaign which encouraged people to cultivate their gardens and allotments due to the difficulty of importing foodstuffs. The graffiti immediately beneath it with the slogan, ‘Vote Joyce, Say Peace’, alludes to the British Nazi propagandist, William Joyce, who broadcast appeals to the British to surrender. The poster on a shop window which reads ‘Smile and say Victory’, hardly seems reassuring amid the general devastation. The conflicting sentiments draw attention to the tensions in British Society during the war. 

The unexpected juxtapositions in Bombed Women and Searchlights indicate Branson’s awareness of Surrealist painters who were represented in an exhibition organised by the Artists International Association (AIA) in 1937 (Morris and Radford, p.41). The AIA was founded in 1933, its initial objective being to mobilise ‘the international unity of artists against Imperialist War on the Soviet Union, Fascism and Colonial oppression’ (Morris and Radford, p.2). As the number of members increased (by 1936 over 600 artists had joined the AIA), their aim was broadened to a popular front against both Fascism and war which they strove to achieve through public murals, documentary photographs and travelling exhibitions of paintings and sculptures. It is not known whether this painting was exhibited, but many of the pictures Branson made while he was living in Battersea were included in an exhibition organised by the Artists’ International Association. In 1941, the year after this painting was made; Branson became a member of the Royal Armoured Corps and was sent overseas to India. He died on active service in Burma in 1944.

Primitive is a multiple screen video installation, created specifically for display within a gallery, by Thai filmmaker Apichatpong Weerasethakul. It consists of seven videos of differing durations in which the history of the border town of Nabua, in northeast Thailand, is re-imagined as an elusive science fiction ghost story rooted in Thai folklore. The work comprises eight projections, since one of the videos, Primitive which gives the work its name, is shown on two synchronised screens. The seven videos are: Primitive (duration 29 minutes 34 seconds), Nabua (duration 9 minutes 11 seconds), Making of the Spaceship (duration 28 minutes 13 seconds), A Dedicated Machine (duration 1 minute), An Evening Shoot (duration 4 minutes 10 seconds), I'm Still Breathing (music video, duration 11 minutes) and Nabua Song (music video, duration 4 minutes 12 seconds). Nabua, situated where the Mekong River divides Thailand from Laos, was historically the scene of considerable racial strife and violence. From the 1960s until the early 1980s it was a ‘red zone’ where the Mao-influenced Communists hid in the jungle. The Thai army curbed the communist insurgent farmers through physical and psychological abuse and murder. The town also harbours an ancient legend about a widow ghost who would abduct any man who entered her empire, earning it the nickname ‘widow town’. Weerasethakul transforms the town into one of men, the teenage male descendants of the farmer communists, freed from the widow ghost’s empire. These teenagers fabricate their own memories and build a new world, manufacturing a spaceship in the ricefields.
For Weerasethakul the jungle is a place of darkness and mystery, in which distinctions between the fictional and the real dissolve. It is a parallel world, populated by enchanted spectres, where mystery and emotion mingle in shadow. The jungle forms a perfect stage for the artist’s fascination with reincarnation, transformation and light. Curator James Quandt has commented that Weerasethakul’s work turns ‘everyday objects and images into the ineffable and enigmatic, inhabitants of a phantom zone where the hard, “real” world of cars and bodies and buildings cedes dominion to a magical realm of reverie and desire’ (Österreichisches Filmmuseum and SYNEMA – Gesellschaft für Film und Medien 2009).
The artist has stated that Primitive is ‘a reincarnation of presence (and absence). It’s also a reincarnation of cinema as a means of transportation as it was in the time of the early cinema innovator Georges Méliès: the “motion picture” carries us from our own world. Primitive is a meditation on those voyages in fabulous vehicles that bring about the transformation of people and of light’ (unpublished artist’s statement, September 2008).
Inspired in part by surrealism, Weerasethakul’s films present a world that is distinctly mutable and elusive, evoking the artist’s interest in the surrealist game Exquisite Corpse, whereby players add words or images sequentially to a sentence or diagram without knowing what came before, so as to construct a fanciful, multi-layered scenario. Conventional narrative unravels as storylines change course and genre morphs from fiction to fantasy to documentary. Drawing heavily on anecdotal traditions from rural Thai villagers, as well as personal politics, social issues and his own early fascination",1.0,1.0

This painting is inscribed 'Ceret' on the back, which confirms that it was painted at C?ret (Pyren?es-Orientales) in 1911, when Braque was spending the summer there in the company of Picasso. They had gone to C?ret at the suggestion of their friend the Catalan sculptor Manolo, who had settled there three years before.

This was Braque's first picture of a still-life group on a mantelpiece, a theme which became the basis for a number of his later works. The objects include a bottle of rum, a clarinet, some sheet music and a pin or nail with its cast shadow. Lower down one can identify a pair of scroll-like corbels, left and right, which support the mantel, and a scallop-shaped motif which is either the handle of a fire screen or, more probably, a decorative feature on the canopy at the top of the fireplace to prevent smoke escaping.

Though it appears in the Kahnweiler records as 'Clarinet and Bottle of Rum' and is listed by Isarlov as 'The Mantelpiece', there seems some advantage in keeping the more extended title 'Clarinet and Bottle of Rum on a Mantelpiece' under which it has been known in recent years.

This is one of a series of radically simplified heads with elongated faces and stylised features that Modigliani made between 1911 and 1913. He was inspired by art from countries such as Cambodia, Egypt and Ivory Coast, which he saw in Paris’s ethnography museum. His patron Paul Alexandre recalled how Modigliani worked in this period: ‘When a figure haunted his mind, he would draw feverishly with unbelievable speed… He sculpted the same way. He drew for a long time, then he attacked the block directly.’

Three large slabs of textured black marble form a tapering wedge-shaped cubicle which is closed at the narrower end. The middle slab has a window cut out of it in the form of a square, a triangle and a semi-circle bleeding into each other. A wooden-box speaker stands on the floor at the end of the cubicle. Five further slabs of marble are laid flat on the floor around the cubicle, abutting its edges. They describe a form approximating to a ‘Y’, where the arms enclose the cubicle on either side of its two walls, and the leg is aligned with and extends beyond its closed end. The arms of the ‘Y’, stretching beyond the entry to the cubicle on either side, have rounded ends. A brass pole slots into a hole in the marble at the end of the leg of the ‘Y’. A roughly elliptical shape cut out of chipboard is mounted on this, facing away from the sculpture. Cartridge paper, covered in rough pencil shading before being cut to size, covers both sides of the chipboard. In the centre of the pencil shading a cluster of differently sized, coloured plastic boxes is bolted together on one surface of the elliptical form. It forms an abstract composition of three dimensional coloured rectangles. The sound playing on the speaker is a recording of ‘Over the Rainbow/What a Wonderful World’ by Hawaiian ukulele player and singer Isreal Kamakawiwo’ole (1959-97). The track, which features only the singer’s voice and ukulele, plays for six minutes followed by six minutes of silence, repeated on a ninety minute loop. It is generally known as the soundtrack to the Hollywood film Meet Joe Black
1997, directed by Martin Brest, where it accompanied the opening scene on the American war in Vietnam.

Webb developed his practice during his BA at Goldsmiths College of Art (1994-7). He specialises in sculptural assemblages uniting traditional and modern materials in unexpected combinations and configurations. Mixing abstraction with geometry and synthetic found objects with invented forms, he has created an unique hybrid language of his own. Much of Webb’s work is an attempt to make tangible internalised emotions. Initially expressed in spontaneous drawings, they are then developed into three dimensional objects which frequently bear only tangential relationship to their starting point. He has explained:


The time that is involved between making the drawings and making the work builds a space where I can understand what something could possibly be. It allows a sort of a bleakness and obliqueness. Every single time I’ve made something, I don’t know what I’m looking for, so in a way I’m on exactly the same level as the viewer, except I’m responsible for this thing ... My works are not the sort of thing which two viewers will get the same thing from ... With my stuff, people can appear to share the same conversation, yet find each is talking about something completely different, or at least have a different take on it. Talking about the work, the language and the way that I describe the whole process somehow gets confused. However, the tonality of that language and description is very close to the nature of the way the work is made. So even my language – not really fully being able to express the way that these sculptures are and what they’re about – should be examined. It’s hard for me to separate the two.

(Quoted in Tailsliding, p.41)

Webb developed his practice during his BA at Goldsmiths College of Art (1994-7). He specialises in sculptural assemblages uniting traditional and modern materials in unexpected combinations and configurations. Mixing abstraction with geometry and synthetic found objects with invented forms, he has created an unique hybrid language of his own. Much of Webb’s work is an attempt to make tangible internalised emotions. Initially expressed in spontaneous drawings, they are then developed into three dimensional objects which frequently bear only tangential relationship to their starting point. He has explained:

The time that is involved between making the drawings and making the work builds a space where I can understand what something could possibly be. It allows a sort of a bleakness and obliqueness. Every single time I’ve made something, I don’t know what I’m looking for, so in a way I’m on exactly the same level as the viewer, except I’m responsible for this thing ... My works are not the sort of thing which two viewers will get the same thing from ... With my stuff, people can appear to share the same conversation, yet find each is talking about something completely different, or at least have a different take on it. Talking about the work, the language and the way that I describe the whole process somehow gets confused. However, the tonality of that language and description is very close to the nature of the way the work is made. So even my language – not really fully being able to express the way that these sculptures are and what they’re about – should be examined. It’s hard for me to separate the two.

The Unfinished Conversation 2012 is a three-screen video installation that explores the multi-layered and ever-evolving subject of identity through an exploration of the memories and archives of the acclaimed British cultural theorist and sociologist Stuart Hall (1932–2014). The film is narrated in a non-linear format and unfolds over three screens, bringing up a variety of disparate footage simultaneously. This process examines the nature of the visual as triggered across an individual’s memory. Extracted images from news footage of the 1960s, alongside Hall’s personal home videos and photographs, are presented to merge the past, present and future. Akomfrah weaves issues of cultural identity into the film using a wide range of reference, overlaying archive footage of Hall with a soundtrack made up of jazz and gospel music and readings from a wide range of authors, including William Blake, Charles Dickens, Virginia Woolf and Mervyn Peake.
In the footage used in Unfinished Conversation Hall discusses his discovery of his personal and ethnic identity. Born in Kingston, Jamaica into a middle class family where he was the ‘darkest’ member, he quickly found that this had an immense effect on his upbringing in Jamaica. He arrived in Britain as a young man in 1951, graduated from  Oxford University and went on to become one of the founding figures of British Cultural Studies and a strong voice on the journal New Left Review, alongside other intellectuals such as E.P. Thompson and Raymond Williams. Hall’s arrival in Britain in the early 1950s was only shortly after the ‘Windrush generation’, whose arrival on board the SS Empire Windrush in 1948 marked the start of post-war mass migration from the Caribbean to England. Hall married an English woman and, in 1968, defined himself for the first time not as West Indian (he is of mixed Portuguese-Jewish, African and English descent) but as ‘black’ – a political identity that frames his evolving idea of multiculturalism. Akomfrah’s film, which only focuses on Hall’s formative years of the 1950s and 1960s, also encompasses wider international political changes, for example the Soviet invasion of Hungary, the Vietnam war and the riots in Britain. Akomfrah’s use of different footage and multiple screens also portrays how identity is formed as part of a collision of history, culture and politics. Identity is presented as a conjunction of the outside and the inside, where individual subjectivities are formed in both real and fictive spaces. 
The title of the work refers to Hall’s exposition of identity. According to Hall, identity is not an essence or being, but instead a becoming that is part of an ‘ever-unfinished conversation’. The exploration of Hall’s memory is used with a variety of images intermingling with poetic soundscapes. Akomfrah has credited the immense influence Stuart Hall has had on his practice, particularly during the time of the artist’s involvement with the Black Audio Film Collective (BAFC, 1982–98), of which he was a founder member. When BAFC’s film Handsworth Songs 1986 (Tate T12862) was attacked by the writer Salman Rushdie in a review in the Guardian in 1987, Hall was a strong advocate for the group. The Unfinished Conversation was made over a period of three and a half years during which time Akomfrah worked closely with Hall.  
The three-screen video installation has been shown in a variety of significant Biennials and exhibitions including the Sharjah Biennial, Taipei Biennial and Liverpool Biennial, all in 2012, and at New Art Exchange, Nottingham  and Tate Britai",1.0,1.0

Channel 2014 is a series of twenty-nine near-square format photographs taken in a small mangrove forest on the coast of Port Dickson, Simryn Gill’s hometown in Malaysia. Nine of the photographs are black and white gelatin silver prints and twenty are colour Ilfochrome prints. They can be shown as a full set, in smaller groups or as individual works; there is no specified order in which the pictures are to be hung. The series exists in an edition of two, of which this is the second, plus one artist’s proof. The photographs show the coastal environment of Port Dickson, framed and criss-crossed by mangrove trees. Entangled in the branches and projecting roots are colourful plastic bags and other items of domestic detritus that have been washed up by the rise and fall of the daily tides. Hanging almost like clothes on a washing line, these plastic and fabric remnants have been integrated into Gill’s compositions like an integral part of the landscape. One photograph in the series does not show any litter on the shore, but rather an expanse of sea with a large ship approaching the port.

Channel is one of a number of series in which Gill has been concerned with Port Dickson. She has been recording the industrial port town since 1993, using a range of different media from installations of cubes made from termite soil from the area, to photographic series such as Channel. An earlier series of forty photographs, A Small Town at the Turn of the Century 1999–2000 (Tate P13507), includes images shot at the same beach where Channel was made (prints #1, #4 and #16 of A Small Town at the Turn of the Century). 

Channel is representative of Gill’s practice, in which the use of natural materials and ideas of modification are important concepts. Curator Jessica Morgan has written: ‘Not only do people become fruit, but also books become vegetation, discarded or crushed objects develop mobility, photographs become sculpture, people become books, and books become beads.’ (Jessica Morgan, ‘No Place like Home’, in Storer, Morgan and Taussig 2008, p.60.) Transformation is thus an element of the work on a number of levels, including artistic genres and media as well as the objects photographed. Gill routinely collects shells, driftwood, plastic bottles and shards on the beach, classifying these found objects according to form, colour and material. By choosing to photograph items entangled in the trees, she has added another layer to this practice. The fact that Channel comprises both black and white and colour photographs suggests that the artist was looking at each individual object and scene in detail, for its compositional effect, and exploiting the qualities of the different photographic prints and processes. The gelatin silver prints focus on the dynamic forms of the trees, tangled pieces of litter and the water; the ilfochrome prints accentuate the colours of the found objects and the surrounding environment. 
Focusing on normally overlooked litter, shaped and expelled by the sea, Channel draws attention to the shipping of products to and from Port Dickson and, more widely, raises questions about migration and globalisation. The contamination of the mangrove forest by plastic waste invokes the complex and difficult relationship between humankind and the environment. In using her last remaining stocks of Ilfochrome paper – which is no longer manufactured – to print the twenty colour photographs of the Channel series, Gill highlights the transien",1.0,1.0

Channel 2014 is a series of twenty-nine near-square format photographs taken in a small mangrove forest on the coast of Port Dickson, Simryn Gill’s hometown in Malaysia. Nine of the photographs are black and white gelatin silver prints and twenty are colour Ilfochrome prints. They can be shown as a full set, in smaller groups or as individual works; there is no specified order in which the pictures are to be hung. The series exists in an edition of two, of which this is the second, plus one artist’s proof. The photographs show the coastal environment of Port Dickson, framed and criss-crossed by mangrove trees. Entangled in the branches and projecting roots are colourful plastic bags and other items of domestic detritus that have been washed up by the rise and fall of the daily tides. Hanging almost like clothes on a washing line, these plastic and fabric remnants have been integrated into Gill’s compositions like an integral part of the landscape. One photograph in the series does not show any litter on the shore, but rather an expanse of sea with a large ship approaching the port.

Channel is one of a number of series in which Gill has been concerned with Port Dickson. She has been recording the industrial port town since 1993, using a range of different media from installations of cubes made from termite soil from the area, to photographic series such as Channel. An earlier series of forty photographs, A Small Town at the Turn of the Century 1999–2000 (Tate P13507), includes images shot at the same beach where Channel was made (prints #1, #4 and #16 of A Small Town at the Turn of the Century). 

Channel is representative of Gill’s practice, in which the use of natural materials and ideas of modification are important concepts. Curator Jessica Morgan has written: ‘Not only do people become fruit, but also books become vegetation, discarded or crushed objects develop mobility, photographs become sculpture, people become books, and books become beads.’ (Jessica Morgan, ‘No Place like Home’, in Storer, Morgan and Taussig 2008, p.60.) Transformation is thus an element of the work on a number of levels, including artistic genres and media as well as the objects photographed. Gill routinely collects shells, driftwood, plastic bottles and shards on the beach, classifying these found objects according to form, colour and material. By choosing to photograph items entangled in the trees, she has added another layer to this practice. The fact that Channel comprises both black and white and colour photographs suggests that the artist was looking at each individual object and scene in detail, for its compositional effect, and exploiting the qualities of the different photographic prints and processes. The gelatin silver prints focus on the dynamic forms of the trees, tangled pieces of litter and the water; the ilfochrome prints accentuate the colours of the found objects and the surrounding environment. 
Focusing on normally overlooked litter, shaped and expelled by the sea, Channel draws attention to the shipping of products to and from Port Dickson and, more widely, raises questions about migration and globalisation. The contamination of the mangrove forest by plastic waste invokes the complex and difficult relationship between humankind and the environment.

Channel 2014 is a series of twenty-nine near-square format photographs taken in a small mangrove forest on the coast of Port Dickson, Simryn Gill’s hometown in Malaysia. Nine of the photographs are black and white gelatin silver prints and twenty are colour Ilfochrome prints. They can be shown as a full set, in smaller groups or as individual works; there is no specified order in which the pictures are to be hung. The series exists in an edition of two, of which this is the second, plus one artist’s proof. The photographs show the coastal environment of Port Dickson, framed and criss-crossed by mangrove trees. Entangled in the branches and projecting roots are colourful plastic bags and other items of domestic detritus that have been washed up by the rise and fall of the daily tides. Hanging almost like clothes on a washing line, these plastic and fabric remnants have been integrated into Gill’s compositions like an integral part of the landscape. One photograph in the series does not show any litter on the shore, but rather an expanse of sea with a large ship approaching the port.

Channel is one of a number of series in which Gill has been concerned with Port Dickson. She has been recording the industrial port town since 1993, using a range of different media from installations of cubes made from termite soil from the area, to photographic series such as Channel. An earlier series of forty photographs, A Small Town at the Turn of the Century 1999–2000 (Tate P13507), includes images shot at the same beach where Channel was made (prints #1, #4 and #16 of A Small Town at the Turn of the Century). 

Channel is representative of Gill’s practice, in which the use of natural materials and ideas of modification are important concepts. Curator Jessica Morgan has written: ‘Not only do people become fruit, but also books become vegetation, discarded or crushed objects develop mobility, photographs become sculpture, people become books, and books become beads.’ (Jessica Morgan, ‘No Place like Home’, in Storer, Morgan and Taussig 2008, p.60.) Transformation is thus an element of the work on a number of levels, including artistic genres and media as well as the objects photographed. Gill routinely collects shells, driftwood, plastic bottles and shards on the beach, classifying these found objects according to form, colour and material. By choosing to photograph items entangled in the trees, she has added another layer to this practice. The fact that Channel comprises both black and white and colour photographs suggests that the artist was looking at each individual object and scene in detail, for its compositional effect, and exploiting the qualities of the different photographic prints and processes. The gelatin silver prints focus on the dynamic forms of the trees, tangled pieces of litter and the water; the ilfochrome prints accentuate the colours of the found objects and the surrounding environment. 
Focusing on normally overlooked litter, shaped and expelled by the sea, Channel draws attention to the shipping of products to and from Port Dickson and, more widely, raises questions about migration and globalisation. The contamination of the mangrove forest by plastic waste invokes the complex and difficult relationship between humankind and the environment.

Channel 2014 is a series of twenty-nine near-square format photographs taken in a small mangrove forest on the coast of Port Dickson, Simryn Gill’s hometown in Malaysia. Nine of the photographs are black and white gelatin silver prints and twenty are colour Ilfochrome prints. They can be shown as a full set, in smaller groups or as individual works; there is no specified order in which the pictures are to be hung. The series exists in an edition of two, of which this is the second, plus one artist’s proof. The photographs show the coastal environment of Port Dickson, framed and criss-crossed by mangrove trees. Entangled in the branches and projecting roots are colourful plastic bags and other items of domestic detritus that have been washed up by the rise and fall of the daily tides. Hanging almost like clothes on a washing line, these plastic and fabric remnants have been integrated into Gill’s compositions like an integral part of the landscape. One photograph in the series does not show any litter on the shore, but rather an expanse of sea with a large ship approaching the port.

Channel is one of a number of series in which Gill has been concerned with Port Dickson. She has been recording the industrial port town since 1993, using a range of different media from installations of cubes made from termite soil from the area, to photographic series such as Channel. An earlier series of forty photographs, A Small Town at the Turn of the Century 1999–2000 (Tate P13507), includes images shot at the same beach where Channel was made (prints #1, #4 and #16 of A Small Town at the Turn of the Century). 

Channel is representative of Gill’s practice, in which the use of natural materials and ideas of modification are important concepts. Curator Jessica Morgan has written: ‘Not only do people become fruit, but also books become vegetation, discarded or crushed objects develop mobility, photographs become sculpture, people become books, and books become beads.’ (Jessica Morgan, ‘No Place like Home’, in Storer, Morgan and Taussig 2008, p.60.) Transformation is thus an element of the work on a number of levels, including artistic genres and media as well as the objects photographed. Gill routinely collects shells, driftwood, plastic bottles and shards on the beach, classifying these found objects according to form, colour and material. By choosing to photograph items entangled in the trees, she has added another layer to this practice. The fact that Channel comprises both black and white and colour photographs suggests that the artist was looking at each individual object and scene in detail, for its compositional effect, and exploiting the qualities of the different photographic prints and processes. The gelatin silver prints focus on the dynamic forms of the trees, tangled pieces of litter and the water; the ilfochrome prints accentuate the colours of the found objects and the surrounding environment. 
Focusing on normally overlooked litter, shaped and expelled by the sea, Channel draws attention to the shipping of products to and from Port Dickson and, more widely, raises questions about migration and globalisation. The contamination of the mangrove forest by plastic waste invokes the complex and difficult relationship between humankind and the environment.

Channel 2014 is a series of twenty-nine near-square format photographs taken in a small mangrove forest on the coast of Port Dickson, Simryn Gill’s hometown in Malaysia. Nine of the photographs are black and white gelatin silver prints and twenty are colour Ilfochrome prints. They can be shown as a full set, in smaller groups or as individual works; there is no specified order in which the pictures are to be hung. The series exists in an edition of two, of which this is the second, plus one artist’s proof. The photographs show the coastal environment of Port Dickson, framed and criss-crossed by mangrove trees. Entangled in the branches and projecting roots are colourful plastic bags and other items of domestic detritus that have been washed up by the rise and fall of the daily tides. Hanging almost like clothes on a washing line, these plastic and fabric remnants have been integrated into Gill’s compositions like an integral part of the landscape. One photograph in the series does not show any litter on the shore, but rather an expanse of sea with a large ship approaching the port.

Channel is one of a number of series in which Gill has been concerned with Port Dickson. She has been recording the industrial port town since 1993, using a range of different media from installations of cubes made from termite soil from the area, to photographic series such as Channel. An earlier series of forty photographs, A Small Town at the Turn of the Century 1999–2000 (Tate P13507), includes images shot at the same beach where Channel was made (prints #1, #4 and #16 of A Small Town at the Turn of the Century). 

Channel is representative of Gill’s practice, in which the use of natural materials and ideas of modification are important concepts. Curator Jessica Morgan has written: ‘Not only do people become fruit, but also books become vegetation, discarded or crushed objects develop mobility, photographs become sculpture, people become books, and books become beads.’ (Jessica Morgan, ‘No Place like Home’, in Storer, Morgan and Taussig 2008, p.60.) Transformation is thus an element of the work on a number of levels, including artistic genres and media as well as the objects photographed. Gill routinely collects shells, driftwood, plastic bottles and shards on the beach, classifying these found objects according to form, colour and material. By choosing to photograph items entangled in the trees, she has added another layer to this practice. The fact that Channel comprises both black and white and colour photographs suggests that the artist was looking at each individual object and scene in detail, for its compositional effect, and exploiting the qualities of the different photographic prints and processes. The gelatin silver prints focus on the dynamic forms of the trees, tangled pieces of litter and the water; the ilfochrome prints accentuate the colours of the found objects and the surrounding environment. 
Focusing on normally overlooked litter, shaped and expelled by the sea, Channel draws attention to the shipping of products to and from Port Dickson and, more widely, raises questions about migration and globalisation. The contamination of the mangrove forest by plastic waste invokes the complex and difficult relationship between humankind and the environment.

A Small Town at the Turn of the Century is a series of forty square-format c-type photographs taken in Simryn Gill’s home town of Port Dickson in Malaysia. The series exists in an edition of five of which Tate’s copy is number one. The photographs can be shown as a full set, in smaller groups, or as individual works. Although the artist has previously displayed them pinned directly to the wall, they can also be framed. There is no particular order in which they need to be displayed.
The photographs feature people whose faces are hidden by tropical fruits, which act as substitutes for heads. Some photographs show a group of people, while others show individuals. Some were taken inside houses; others were taken outside. There are numerous variations on the subjects’ poses and accoutrements, often suggesting work or leisure activities, such as playing golf, fishing or drinking tea. A variety of fruits appear in the series, including watermelons, durians, jackfruits and bunches of bananas. The subjects of the photographs go about their business as if it were normal to have fruit heads. The colourful compositions and absurd combination of fruit heads and human bodies convey a surreal, humorous and cartoon-like aesthetic. As the title suggests, the photographs were taken at the turn of the twenty-first century.

A Small Town at the Turn of the Century is representative of Gill’s practice, in which modification and transformation are important concepts. As curator Jessica Morgan has written: ‘Not only do people become fruit, but also books become vegetation, discarded or crushed objects develop mobility, photographs become sculpture, people become books, and books become beads’ (Morgan in Museum of Contemporary Art Sydney 2008, p.60). Transformation is found in Gill’s work on a number of different levels, including artistic genres and media as well as subject matter, questioning and blurring the lines between fixed categorisations. By morphing her sitters’ faces into fruits, Gill equates them with the tropical vegetation associated with their country while leading the artistic genres of portrait and still life to the point of absurdity. The motif of combining human subjects with plants can also be found in a number of Gill’s earlier photographic series. Out of my Hair 1995 (Art Gallery of New South Wales, Sydney), for instance, includes a photograph of a woman who wears a wig made from banana skins. Vegetation 1999 (Art Gallery of New South Wales, Sydney), on the other hand, consists of self-portraits of the artist, whose face is disguised by various plant species local to the landscapes in which the photographs were taken. A Small Town at the Turn of the Century is also representative of Gill’s practices as a whole in its use of natural materials. Her photographs, installations and object-based works often include fruits, fruit skins, tree roots or seeds.
While using a cheerful and humorous language, A Small Town at the Turn of the Century nevertheless raises critical questions around identity and postcolonialism. The combination of human subjects with fruits invokes the close relationship between humankind and the plant world and the interrelations between culture and nature. Hiding the faces behind fruits, Gill also shows how identities can be hidden and new ones imposed upon them through visual appearance and habitat. Gill addresses the possibility of multiple and changing identities by demonstrating the arbitrary and manipulable nature of their formation. Furthermore, the playful equation of the Malaysian sitters with tropical fruits raises questions regarding stereotypical associations of o",1.0,1.0

In the late 1920s, John Skeaping made a rapid transition from Rome Scholar to prominent member of the ‘new movement’ in sculpture, to which he was introduced by Barbara Hepworth. Fortified by the pre-war work of Jacob Epstein and Henri Gaudier-Brzeska, and that of Parisians such as Constantin Brancusi and Ossip Zadkine, those gathered into this group included Henry Moore, Maurice Lambert, Richard Bedford and Alan Durst. Their perceived novelty lay in the practice of ‘direct carving’ associated with a modernist concentration on ‘truth to materials’ and contrasted with sculptural modelling. Charles Harrison has emphasised that this facilitated a sculptural equivalent to Clive Bell’s theory of an aesthetic emotion in painting evoked through ‘significant form’,[1] as exemplified in R.H. Wilenski’s assertion at the time that a work with ‘sculptural meaning need have no other’.[2]
These issues were also combined in Kineton Parkes’s tellingly entitled The Art of Carved Sculpture (London 1931), where the ‘glyptic’ quality was associated with personal expression and traced to ancient origins.


Skeaping’s contribution lay in his experience of stone carving. He demonstrated his skills - as did Hepworth - through single animal or figure subjects in a wide variety of stones. In his work ‘the quality and character of the marble, wood, or stone [played] a great part in the conception and in the finish of the subject carved’.[3] In this respect, the rounded forms of Burmese Dancer demonstrated the relativ",1.0,1.0

These issues were also combined in Kineton Parkes’s tellingly entitled The Art of Carved Sculpture (London 1931), where the ‘glyptic’ quality was associated with personal expression and traced to ancient origins.


Skeaping’s contribution lay in his experience of stone carving. He demonstrated his skills - as did Hepworth - through single animal or figure subjects in a wide variety of stones. In his work ‘the quality and character of the marble, wood, or stone [played] a great part in the conception and in the finish of the subject carved’.[3] In this respect, the rounded forms of Burmese Dancer demonstrated the relative softness of the alabaster, which, as a result, was ‘not usually ... used for carving of great fineness and precision’.[4] With the exception of the deep cutting around the neck and arms, the mass of the block was largely maintained; as seen in the flat back of the figure’s legs. The circular dimple in the upper lip appears to have been drilled, and the face was generally quite crudely cut. A number of blemishes - particularly those on the left side of the head - were filled with plaster or putty. The four curves in the front of the skirt anticipate the use of incised line by both Skeaping and Hepworth over the following years.


The choice of a creamy alabaster for Burmese Dancer allowed for a natural translucence.

Haraguchi is from Yokosuka, the primary US naval base in Japan during the Vietnam War. He has said he came to understand ‘the true nature of creativity’ after watching a jet fighter being transported onto the naval base in 1968. He handcrafted a full-scale reproduction of the jet’s tail and made a related series of Airpipe constructions that resemble the jet engine exhausts. Bulging out from the wall, this piece demonstrates Haraguchi’s ability to combine a minimalist sculptural vocabulary with the aesthetics of militarism and heavy industry, raising questions about the environment, modernisation and war.

Elisabeth Frink made her first series of heads in 1959. In the mid 1960s she began work on series of heads which demonstrated her attitude towards violence. ‘Soldier's Head’ i–iv 1965 and ‘Heads’ 1967 led to ‘Goggled Heads’ 1969, in which the artist's feelings about the Algerian war and the aggression of the Moroccan strongmen are reflected.

Later, in ‘Tribute Heads’ i–iv 1975, Frink turned her attention from aggressors to the victim. These heads are:


a tribute to all people who have died or suffered for their beliefs. These men are heroes in the sense that they are survivors, but they are also victims stripped of everything but their human courage. (Elisabeth Frink in conversation with Sarah Kent, quoted in the catalogue of the exhibition Elisabeth Frink, Sculpture in Winohester, July–September 1981 (n.p.).


‘In Memoriam i’ and ‘In Memoriam ii’ relate very closely to the ‘Tribute’ series in that they are also a tribute to people who have suffered for their beliefs. Man's inhumanity to man is a subject that has concerned the artist since the early 1950s when she made her prize winning maquette for the ‘Monument to the Unknown Political Prisoner’ 1953. Both the ‘Tribute’ and the ‘In Memoriam’ heads are a tribute to Amnesty International, whose work Elisabeth Frink has supported over the years. In an interview with Norman Rosenthal in 1985 the artist commented:

My recent heads - the monumental ones - are to do with Amnesty and human rights because they are memorials to people who are suffering for their beliefs (catalogue of Frink retrospective exhibition, Royal Academy, February–March 1985, p.25)

The ‘In Memoriam’ heads represent all victims of state persecution, not individuals; according to the artist they represent the ‘thousands of people who are being tortured today’ (letter to the cataloguer, February 1986).

The profiles of T03416 and T03417 have been thinned down from the thick set jaws of the ‘Goggled’ and ‘Soldier’ heads; unlike the ‘Tribute’ heads their eyes are open, staring ahead. In Elisabeth Frink, Sculpture, Catalogue Raisonné Sarah Kent characterises them as personifying st",1.0,1.0

Lips are sealed into hard lines of endurance...the blank stare that indicated dumb stupidity [‘Goggled Heads’] now becomes an inward gaze produced by suffering and isolation (p.64).


The artist originally intended the heads to form a pair, but two individual casts of each head have been sold. Individual casts of ‘In Memoriam 1’ are in private collections in Australia and Greece and individual casts of ‘In Memoriam II’ are at Margam Sculpture Park and Yorkshire Sculpture Park.

The complete edition of six has been cast at the Meridian Bronze company in Peckham, London.

This is one of a group of three quilted canvas works in Tate’s collection by the Filipino artist Pacita Abad (see also Bacongo III 1986, Tate T15298, and European Mask 1990, Tate T15297). They are part of a series that Abad began in the late 1970s. Referring to them as trapuntos, from the Italian word for embroidery or quilt, these works are the artist’s responses to the cultural traditions that she encountered during her travels in Asia, Africa and Latin America, although they also refer to vernacular traditions of sewing – a traditional part of family education in the Philippines. They were made using large pieces of canvas onto which the artist stitched forms, creating a three-dimensional effect by stuffing the canvases and transforming their surface with paint, shells, buttons, beads, mirrors and other objects collected on her travels. Their decorated surfaces integrate a range of patterning techniques to create semi-figurative forms with what look like large eyes set in stylised, mask-like faces. Abad dispensed with stretcher bars and hung these works directly on the wall or from the ceiling and this, combined with the distinctive technique, transformed the relatively flat surface of a picture into something more multi-dimensional. The portability of the trapunto form can be said to resonate with the peripatetic aspect of a migrant existence as experienced by the artist, being an object that can theoretically be rolled up and more easily transported than a stretched painting.
Inspired by her travels and interest in responding to cultural traditions in Indonesia, Bangladesh, Sudan, Philippines and elsewhere, Abad’s aim in her work was to connect with the world through a vibrant formal language that integrated her interest in traditional art forms such as batik painting in Indonesia, ink-brush painting in Korea, tie-dye in Africa and macramé in Papua New Guinea, all within a language of abstraction and figuration. Dismayed by Western-centric artistic styles while studying at the Corcoran School of Art in Washington D.C. in the mid-1970s, Abad became interested in social realism and also encountered works by the Mexican muralists Diego Rivera (1886–1957), David Siqueiros (1896–1974) and José Clemente Orozco (1883–1949) during a trip to Mexico in 1986. She sought to rejuvenate different artistic traditions and indigenous forms in order to respond to the social and political realities of communities she encountered, in particular refugees, immigrants and others at the margins of society. Of the artist’s motivations, the curators Joselina Cruz and Pio Abad have written:

The narratives which Abad painted to speak about contemporary art and culture in the Philippines were often located elsewhere. Immigration for her was an important issue but more so when she observed the US becoming more disturbed with a changing ‘multiethnic society of legal and illegal immigrants’. Her work was ‘multi-ethnic’ as it brought together experiences across cultures – Bangladesh to Sudan, Sudan to Jakarta, Jakarta to Boston, Washington DC to Manila, Yemen to Singapore – her creative trajectory dictated by her constantly shifting location … Importantly, she also referenced and painted a multiplicity of conditions which were not of her lived experience, but which, at the same time was the story of her life.(Joselina Cruz and Pio Abad, in Museum of Contemporary Art and Design 2018; unpaginated.)

Referring to them as trapuntos, from the Italian word for embroidery or quilt, these works are the artist’s responses to the cultural traditions that she encountered during her travels in Asia, Africa and Latin America, although they also refer to vernacular traditions of sewing – a traditional part of family education in the Philippines. They were made using large pieces of canvas onto which the artist stitched forms, creating a three-dimensional effect by stuffing the canvases and transforming their surface with paint, shells, buttons, beads, mirrors and other objects collected on her travels. Their decorated surfaces integrate a range of patterning techniques to create semi-figurative forms with what look like large eyes set in stylised, mask-like faces. Abad dispensed with stretcher bars and hung these works directly on the wall or from the ceiling and this, combined with the distinctive technique, transformed the relatively flat surface of a picture into something more multi-dimensional. The portability of the trapunto form can be said to resonate with the peripatetic aspect of a migrant existence as experienced by the artist, being an object that can theoretically be rolled up and more easily transported than a stretched painting.
Inspired by her travels and interest in responding to cultural traditions in Indonesia, Bangladesh, Sudan, Philippines and elsewhere, Abad’s aim in her work was to connect with the world through a vibrant formal language that integrated her interest in traditional art forms such as batik painting in Indonesia, ink-brush painting in Korea, tie-dye in Africa and macramé in Papua New Guinea, all within a language of abstraction and figuration. Dismayed by Western-centric artistic styles while studying at the Corcoran School of Art in Washington D.C. in the mid-1970s, Abad became interested in social realism and also encountered works by the Mexican muralists Diego Rivera (1886–1957), David Siqueiros (1896–1974) and José Clemente Orozco (1883–1949) during a trip to Mexico in 1986. She sought to rejuvenate different artistic traditions and indigenous forms in order to respond to the social and political realities of communities she encountered, in particular refugees, immigrants and others at the margins of society. Of the artist’s motivations, the curators Joselina Cruz and Pio Abad have written:

The narratives which Abad painted to speak about contemporary art and culture in the Philippines were often located elsewhere. Immigration for her was an important issue but more so when she observed the US becoming more disturbed with a changing ‘multiethnic society of legal and illegal immigrants’. Her work was ‘multi-ethnic’ as it brought together experiences across cultures – Bangladesh to Sudan, Sudan to Jakarta, Jakarta to Boston, Washington DC to Manila, Yemen to Singapore – her creative trajectory dictated by her constantly shifting location … Importantly, she also referenced and painted a multiplicity of conditions which were not of her lived experience, but which, at the same time was the story of her life.(Joselina Cruz and Pio Abad, in Museum of Contemporary Art and Design 2018, unpaginated.)

Kngwarreye was an Anmatyerre Elder. Her artwork focuses on the area where she lived - Alhalkere country, in the Utopia region of the Northern Territory. The dots and lines in her work often represent the vegetation, animals and landscape of the country, and relate to the Anmatyerre Creation Stories. Untitled (Alhalkere) is one of Kngwarreye’s earliest works using acrylic paint on canvas. She began painting with acrylic in late 1988, when she was already in her seventies. She had previously worked in batik, which is a wax-resist dyeing method originating in Indonesia.

Man of No Importance 2006 consists of a large sculptural head balanced on a simple wooden support and base. The head is constructed with found Styrofoam packaging, which has been painted and covered with a chicken wire armature and then fleshed out with red clay. Formally, the oversize bust is reminiscent of the bearded heads found on classical sculptural herms, often of Greco-Roman gods on top of a square column. In Bhabha’s sculpture, the face bears a single eye, centered on the forehead, a reference to the cyclops – giant mythological creatures who represent brute force and physical power. A hand, holding a gold-painted metal staff, appears from one side. On closer inspection, the sculpture reveals a second, hidden figure secreted within the head and visible from the back and sides of the work. This smaller figure is dressed in robes and has his head bent forward, as if in prayer. Due to the contrast in scale, the Styrofoam interior within which he is placed takes on an architectural presence, a ruin or a chapel, adding a narrative layer to the work. The artist has said about the play of scale in her works, ‘I love the idea of making something that gives the illusion of being huge, but is actually small in relation to the landscape’ (quoted in Salon 94 2010, p.77). Bhabha usually fabricates all of her own work in her studio in upstate New York, working intuitively and building each form according to a method inspired by informal urban architecture, where materials are stacked and placed and, in her words, ‘just lean against one another, touching but not attached. My whole construction process is based on this simple approach.’ (Ibid., p.79.) Man of No Importance is thus characteristic of her practice.
The title is taken from the comedy drama film (1994) directed by Suri Kishnamma and starring Albert Finney, and subsequent musical of the same name; however, Bhabha’s choice does not seem to bear any direct narrative relationship to its reference, but rather appears to refer to the dichotomy between the two figures within the sculpture. 
Bhabha grew up in Karachi, Pakistan, and has acknowledged the formative influence of its arid landscape and improvised urban architecture on her practice. She was first a painter and printmaker, trained at the Rhode Island School of Design and at Columbia University, New York. She began to make sculptural work after moving to New York City in the 1990s, collecting detritus from the city streets as her material. Bhabha gravitated towards materials such as cork and Styrofoam, attracted to them as they are lightweight and can be easily manipulated, while having a bulk and mass that contradicts and belies their weight. This is a paradox she enjoys, alongside the play of scale in her work.
In Pakistan, Bhabha took photographs of the Karachi landscape, particularly of areas under construction and development. In 2011 she began an ongoing series of paintings of heads which seem part-primate, part-mask; or part-human and part-animal. Her work has been described as ‘post-apocalyptic’ (ibid., p.63), but in an interview with artist Julie Mehretu in 2010 she said, ‘I’m not trying to make post-apocalyptic work. My work is very much of the present – informed by my peers, art history, minimalism and Pop Culture.’ (Quoted in ibid., p.80.) She cites influences as diverse as Alberto Giacometti (1901–1966), Egyptian and Cambodian sculpture, science fiction, and references from television and film, particularly the Russian film maker and theorist Andrei Tarkovsky. Works such as Man of No Importance bridge these multiple temporalities, combining the everyday with the dystopian and futuristic, whilst simultaneously channeling archetypes from ancient mythology and art hist",1.0,1.0

Nixon is a video installation that was conceived in 1965 and realised in its current form in 2002. It is composed of two identical twenty-inch colour television monitors connected to a video switcher and audio system. Each monitor is positioned on top of one of two white shelving units, which are placed side by side. The switcher and audio system rest on the shelves below the monitors. Two magnetic coils made by Japanese engineer and electronics expert Shuya Abe are attached to the television monitors and driven by a Mackintosh amplifier. The two monitors screen documentary footage, compiled from television and other sources, of seminal moments in the presidential term of former American president Richard Nixon (1913–1994; incumbent 1969–74). These include Nixon’s inaugural address, televised press conferences on issues from ‘Vietnamisation’ to the Watergate scandal, and his resignation speech. The magnetic coils create a circular frame for the action on each of the screens and distort the received broadcast image, causing the picture to jump and warp as the electrons inside the television respond to the magnetic charge. The switcher box at the bottom of the shelving unit switches the distortion back and forth between the two television sets, ensuring that neither burns out from overexposure to the magnets. The result of the setup is a visually and aurally disrupted sequence of footage that simultaneously animates and undermines the words of the politician.
Reconfigured and stabilised using modern circuitry and voltage control in 2002, when Nam June Paik was living and working in New York, Nixon incorporates the artist’s techniques of image manipulation. In 1960s America, the television broadcasting industry was controlled by a set of rules and standards that dictated what could and could not be shown. For Paik, however, television represented a two-way communication network that was both voyeuristic and participatory – not simply a means by which to receive state programming. Through its wilful distortion of the power of political speech, Nixon questions the control exerted by individuals in positions of influence and the ways in which they make use of popular broadcasting methods such as television to mediate and shape their rhetoric.
Following an education in Tokyo, Paik moved to Germany in 1956 to train as a composer, where he became involved in the new electronic music scene around Cologne. Paik was subsequently employed at the Electronic Studio of the West German public broadcasting corporation (WDR) between 1958 and 1963, which exposed him to new electronic devices, sound-producing equipment and knowledgeable engineers, and spurred him to begin his earliest television experiments.
The results of these innovations were displayed in Paik’s first solo exhibition in Germany, two years before Nixon was first conceived. The exhibition, entitled Exposition of Music – Electronic Television, was held in March 1963 at the Galerie Parnass, Wuppertal, the home of architect and gallerist Rolf Jährling (1913–1991) and his wife Anneliese. It included thirteen television sets which Paik had acquired second-hand, each demonstrating the effects of his manipulative experimental techniques. Traditional broadcast images were distorted and reconfigured into abstract forms, and defects in the television’s cathode-ray tubes caused negative images and horizontal and vertical lines to roll across the screens, while sine waves, radios and tape recorders connected to the television monitors produced images that grew or diminished according to the amplitude of the sound produced.

Neon Rice Field 1993 is a large floor-based installation consisting of seven tons of dry, white long-grain rice underlaid at intervals with six parallel tubes of red neon light. The overall effect is of an undulating translucent field where the light glows amidst the rice. As with many of Phaophanit’s works, light plays an important role in this installation, binding together the different materials to achieve a particular visual effect. In addition to the work’s visual impact, the rice also generates its own particular smell, which pervades the space beyond the physical limits of the piece. 
For the artist, Neon Rice Field relies on the ‘interactions of the materials’ (quoted in Tate Gallery 1993, [p.6]) and brings together two utterly disparate things, one natural and organic and the other manufactured and industrial. These materials carry cultural associations that have often been inscribed within the dichotomy between the Western and the Eastern worlds (in this instance, of industry versus agriculture). However, the cultural allegiances that might be attached to them are more complex, more problematic and more fluid than any dualistic reading allows for. Phaophanit often infuses into his work a discreet subversion of the narratives attached to the materials and, while rice is unequivocally a symbol for the East, he has in the past used American sponsorship to supply the rice to stage his work. Likewise, the presence of neon which could sometimes be assumed to represent the western city is also a feature of many Asian cities. 
Unwilling to attach any predetermined meanings to the work, Phaophanit is concerned with the potential for ‘possibilities of meanings’, and he considers that the materials and their juxtapositions carry their own significance while, at the same time, they open the way to new associations. ‘Once you name all the meanings,’ he has said, ‘something still remains, something left over. That’s how I work. For instance, I use rice not only as a material, a substance, a smell or a symbol of food in the East, but I want to shake things – see what falls down.’ (Quoted in Irish Museum of Modern Art 1997, p. 96.) 
Born in Laos and educated in France, Phaophanit settled in England in 1985. In 1990 he began to incorporate in his work materials such as rice, rubber and bamboo, which are largely produced in South East Asia and have economic, cultural and historical significance. However, Phaophanit has always opposed any readings of his work that reduce it to a reflection on his cultural identity:

Such biographical discourse is very limiting when it comes to talking about the work itself. I don’t only make my work as I do simply because I’m a refugee. It’s also concerned with the way I’m living at the moment. I don’t want to be categorised. I don’t want to be ‘French’ or ‘English’. And I don’t want to be ‘Laotian’.(Vong Phaophanit interviewed by Jonathan Watkins, in Vong Phaophanit: What Falls to the Ground but Can’t be Eaten, exhibition catalogue, Chisenhale Gallery, London 1991, unpaginated.)


Neon Rice Field was first exhibited at the Serpentine Gallery, London in 1993 and later the same year at the Aperto section of the 45th Venice Biennale. It was subsequently shown as Phaophanit’s contribution to the Turner Prize at the Tate Gallery, London in 1993. Over the years, it has been shown in different configurations but always incorporating seven tons of white rice spread over six lines of neon lights.

Lake as a Furnace ... The Black Archers 1976 is executed in pastel on paper. It depicts an area of water, the lake of the title, edged by a jagged, rocky landscape. Some figures standing on the shore of the lake, towards the foreground of the composition, can be identified as the ‘black archers’ of the title by the drawn bows they hold in their hands. The work is inscribed with the artist’s name and its date in the lower right corner. Petlin’s ‘landscapes’, such as this one, depict spaces that are as much invented as they are real, as much cerebral as they are visual. They are composites of the imagined and the viewed, portraying places where Petlin has worked and lived, as well as places that hold larger historical and mythological significance. The landscapes are often viewed from a window, and suggest an interpretation of nature which reflects individual recollection and the realm of collective memory.
Many of Petlin’s pastel works are inspired by post-war writers and intellectuals such as Primo Levi, Bruno Schulz, Paul Celan and Edmond Jabès. Engaging in multiple discourses – political, philosophical, psychological – Petlin examines issues such as American involvement in war and allegories of childhood fables, and the visual meaning of place. The artist has described this approach as an ‘interrogation of memory’ that constantly leads him to further exploration. In California in the 1960s, Petlin collaborated with artists including Mark di Suvero, and New York-based artists Max Kozloff, Claus Oldenburg, Leon Golub and Carl Andre among others, to protest against the war in Vietnam. He continued to make politically and socially motivated work.

The Warlord (Psychedelic Man series) 1966 is a small, distorted portrait of an unidentifiable person set against a white textural background. The figure has been rendered with very loose and thickly applied paint set atop a green underlayer. String has also been added into the mix to add to the texture of the work. The dominant colour is shiny black, in some areas pooling and mixing with oranges, reds and purples to create a marbled effect. Small repetitive lines occasionally emerge from and within the central figure, suggesting spiky hair or violent cuts. The Warlord was the artist’s favourite painting and he often posed for photographs in front of it. Although the painting was exhibited several times during the artist’s lifetime, he always specified that it was not for sale and kept it in his possession throughout his lifetime. It was included in Four Indian Painters, an exhibition organised by the Commonwealth Institute and held at The Grange, Brighton Museum and Art Gallery in 1973.  
Portraits are a recurring subject for Ribeiro throughout his career, always painted from the front and often twisted into dark and grotesque forms as here. The art critic Eunice de Souza linked The Warlord directly to ‘American aggressiveness in Vietnam’ (Buckman 2014, p.83), while other critics have read Ribeiro’s portraits as icons that refer to his Goan Catholic upbringing in Mumbai (Hazell 2013, p.38). The artist himself mentioned this, stating that ‘my first influences … were the churches and statuary of the Catholic church in Goa along with the symbolic ritual that went with it. The other and perhaps the strongest influence were the paintings of my brother, ten years senior.’ (Quoted in Hazell 2013, p.17.) Ribeiro refers here to his half-brother, the artist Francis Newton Souza (1924–2002, Tate T06776, T13899, T00725). Ribeiro worked for Souza as a studio assistant as well as living with him in London at various points after first arriving there from Bombay (now Mumbai) in 1950. He attended life drawing classes at St Martin’s School of Art from 1951–3, before he was conscripted into National Service. He thereafter left London for several years for Bombay, where he began painting and exhibiting widely, before moving permanently back to London in in 1962. He created a large body of figurative and abstract work over his lifetime. 
Together with fellow painters Gajanan D. Bhagwat, Yashwant Mali and Ibrahim Wagh (all previously members of the Bombay Art Society), Ribeiro co-founded the Indian Painters Collective, a group of young Indian artists living and working in London who organised exhibitions of South Asian artists throughout the 1960s and 1970s.

Golub used news photographs and his own experience as a veteran of the Second World War in order to build an allegory of the disconnection generated by conflict.

It belongs to a series of three large-scale works on the subject of the Vietnam War the artist made between 1972 and 1974. The paintings were motivated in part by the American presidential election of 1972, which saw Richard Nixon (1913-94) soundly defeating the anti-war platform of George McGovern (born 1922). Golub had adopted an active stance against the Vietnam conflict for almost a decade at the time these works were made; he joined the anti-war group Artists and Writers Protest on his return to the United States in 1964 after living for several years in Europe. However until this series he had not directly addressed contemporary issues in his work. The Vietnam paintings marked a move in Golub’s work from more ambiguous, classically inspired images of masculinity and power (see Fighter, 1965, Tate P77249) to a more pointed and abrasive political engagement with subject matter which has continued in his work to the present day.

The composition of Vietnam II is polarised. On the left side of the painting are three uniformed American soldiers in front of an armoured car. All three men brandish machine guns, two of which are pointed towards a group of Vietnamese men, women and children huddled on the far right of the image. Behind the civilians are what appears to be the charred remains of a makeshift building; wooden posts and bits of corrugated iron are covered in a thin, sooty wash of paint. A large expanse of bare canvas divides the two groups of figures. The aggression on the faces of the American soldiers is countered by the combination of horror and stoicism in the expressions of the Vietnamese figures, particularly a young boy positioned in the foreground of the image whose face acts as the focal point for the right side of the composition. He stares directly out of the picture, implicating the viewer in the action.

The dynamic postures of the figures were sourced from contemporary news photographs. Golub has described his working process, saying, ‘I begin by projecting drawings or parts of photographs onto the canvas – each figure is a synthesis of different sources ... I want each figure to be both the reconstruction of a generic type and to possess an idiosyncratic singular existence. The figures are first outlined and shaded in black. The second coat emphasizes three dimensionality and designated highlights. I apply local colour to define skin, wood, metal, cloth. The canvas is put on the floor and paint areas are dissolved with solvent and scraped. The main scraping tool is a meat cleaver. Once the canvas has been scraped down, eroded – a process which frequently takes two weeks – I reconstruct the figures’ (quoted in Michael Newman, ‘Interview with Leon Golub’, Leon Golub: Mercenaries and Interrogations, pp.5-6). The process of scraping embeds areas of colour deep in the grain of the support and gives the surface of the painting a rough texture.

The painting is executed on unstretched linen, and hangs directly on the wall from grommets positioned at regular intervals along the top of the canvas. Hanging loosely in this manner, the painting is suggestive of an unfurled banner or an animal hide. Along the bottom edge, three irregular forms have been cut away from the painting. These jagged excisions echo the violence depicted in the image in an assault on the fabric of the artwork.

Golub originally planned to give the Vietnam paintings the collective title Assassins. In re-naming the paintings he not only situated the depicted conflict in a specific time and place but acknowledged the complexities and moral ambiguities of warfare, suggesting that soldiers ordered to fight in an unjust war are subject to a similar experience of de-humanisatio",1.0,1.0

‘Fighter’, which is printed in purple, depicts a striding male figure with one arm raised. The subject of male combatants has dominated Golub's work since the late 1950s. This particular pose is seen again in ‘Gigantomachy II’, 1966 (the artist, repr., Donald Kuspit, Leon Golub: Existentialist/Activist Painter, New Brunswick 1985, p.135, pls.89–90), one of a series of paintings Golub made between 1965 and 1967 depicting nude males in combat. It is possible that the artist began this painting in 1965, near to the time he made P77249. The reddish tone of the figure in the lithograph, which can be seen as symbolic of vigour, appears to have been carried through into the predominantly red colouration of the figure in the painting.

In conversation on 2 November 1988, Golub commented that his fighter images display conflicting traits, reflecting his own ambivalence towards the subject. The fighter in P77249 is, he said, ‘quite heroic in his gestures, the arm is lifted above his head. This gesture is one of alertness and valour’. He continued, ‘my work is continuously between two poles - between aggression and a certain kind of heroism. But it is a heroism which is existential, because [the fighters] can never get out of their fix’. He said that the large scale of the ‘Gigantomachy’ paintings emphasised the heroic nature of the imagery, and that he had intended the ‘Gigantomachy’ series to be viewed from a distance, like Greek temple pediments.

The warriors in Golub's paintings of the late 1950s were inspired by ancient Greek sculpture. The artist explained that in this period he was searching for an objective source of imagery, in which the structure of the body was not exaggerated or stylised in a ‘primitivistic manner’. In the early 1970s he began using contemporary magazine and newspaper photographs as sources for his images of soldiers. He aimed to depict current conflicts, and to register his political opposition to the destructive results of military intervention. He used photographs from the Vietnam war and photographs showing the activities of mercenaries and death squads (see entry on P77251).

‘Wounded Sphinx’, printed in red and blue, depicts a male sphinx with one limb raised and an anguished expression. In conversation at his studio in New York on 2 November 1988, Golub described the sphinx in P77250 as ‘self-wounded’ in one aspect, although he depicted them in related works as wounded by an external being. On an early draft of this entry Golub commented (19 January 1995): ‘Sphinx are agressive. They express also a vulnerability’. P77250 was produced at the Tamarind Lithography Workshop in Los Angeles, where Golub was invited to work for six weeks in the summer of 1965.

The sphinx is an ancient symbol of a division in human consciousness, between the animal and the human, the male and female, reason and instinct. Golub has periodically depicted sphinxes in paintings, drawings and prints since the 1950s. Sphinxes traditionally have human heads and animal bodies, but, on occasion, Golub has depicted ‘Siamese’ sphinxes, with two heads joined at the trunk of the body. Golub made seven paintings and several drawings of this subject between 1954 and 1956, a number of which are reproduced in Donald Kuspit's Leon Golub: Existentialist/Activist Painter (New Brunswick 1985, pp.102–3, 109–112, nos.40–2, 50–4). He made a further group of four sphinx paintings in 1988 (repr. Leon Golub: Paintings 1987–92, exh. cat., Institute of Contemporary Arts, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia 1992, pp.11–18 in col.).

In conversation, Golub said that the hybrid nature of the sphinx suggested several conflicts and levels of meaning:

It is a trapped consciouness, because it is a human head inside an animal body. It is in an indeterminate state which has a lot of force, a lot of power, but does not have control over its world on the same terms as we do. For example, the satyr is described as one-third god, one-third human and one-third beast. I have associated that with the tripartite division in Christianity, or the many religions which have heaven, earth and hell. It is like trying to figure out our destinies: who we are, where we come from, where we are going. We are still asking those same questions... The sphinx is one of those kinds of attempts, metaphorically and symbolically, to bridge through imagery social conflict and self-conflict. How much control do we have over ourselves and our environment?

Golub believes that sphinxes are archetypes and present ‘some way of handling the world as a sort of primitivistic cultural construct. They are ritualised and are what we call non-scientific or pre-scientific art, at least by our western notions of science’. In an interview with Kate Horsfield and Lyn Blumenthal given in 1977 Golub said he employed sphinxes to represent human characteristics: ‘The sphinx is a creature who is part human and part animal; therefore, one is indicating characteristics of humans by making sphinxes. There are no such things as sphinxes’ (‘On Art and Artists: Leon Golub’, Profile, vol.2, no.2, March 1982, p.9). He continued:

We live under technologies, automation, and computerized logics which are huge in scope, a mammoth technological society, and at the same time, in a society which is extremely dominating. Now I'm not saying more brutal than other societies but nevertheless very brutal. We operate massive weapons systems and we export these weapons. There was World War II, Korea, Vietnam. How are you going to make contact with these fantastic numbers of slaughters?",1.0,1.0

‘Fighter’, which is printed in purple, depicts a striding male figure with one arm raised. The subject of male combatants has dominated Golub's work since the late 1950s. This particular pose is seen again in ‘Gigantomachy II’, 1966 (the artist, repr., Donald Kuspit, Leon Golub: Existentialist/Activist Painter, New Brunswick 1985, p.135, pls.89–90), one of a series of paintings Golub made between 1965 and 1967 depicting nude males in combat. It is possible that the artist began this painting in 1965, near to the time he made P77249. The reddish tone of the figure in the lithograph, which can be seen as symbolic of vigour, appears to have been carried through into the predominantly red colouration of the figure in the painting.

In conversation on 2 November 1988, Golub commented that his fighter images display conflicting traits, reflecting his own ambivalence towards the subject. The fighter in P77249 is, he said, ‘quite heroic in his gestures, the arm is lifted above his head. This gesture is one of alertness and valour’. He continued, ‘my work is continuously between two poles - between aggression and a certain kind of heroism. But it is a heroism which is existential, because [the fighters] can never get out of their fix’. He said that the large scale of the ‘Gigantomachy’ paintings emphasised the heroic nature of the imagery, and that he had intended the ‘Gigantomachy’ series to be viewed from a distance, like Greek temple pediments.

The warriors in Golub's paintings of the late 1950s were inspired by ancient Greek sculpture. The artist explained that in this period he was searching for an objective source of imagery, in which the structure of the body was not exaggerated or stylised in a ‘primitivistic manner’. In the early 1970s he began using contemporary magazine and newspaper photographs as sources for his images of soldiers. He aimed to depict current conflicts, and to register his political opposition to the destructive results of military intervention. He used photographs from the Vietnam war and photographs showing the activities of mercenaries and death squads (see entry on P77251). Golub also based his warriors on photographs showing sportsmen in action. The first occasion he depicted warriors in motion was in the painting entitled ‘Combat I’, 1962 (Gene R. Summers, repr. Kuspit 1985, p.128, pl.79), which depicts two warriors clashing.

P77249 was produced at the Tamarind Lithography Workshop in Los Angeles, California, where Golub worked for six weeks during the summer of 1965. Golub said that he blurred the contours of the figure by erasing and redrawing the lines, in an attempt to capture the effect of a figure in motion. This style of drawing emphasised the figure's vitality and energy.

The artist has approved this entry.

It belongs to a series of three large-scale works on the subject of the Vietnam War the artist made between 1972 and 1974. The paintings were motivated in part by the American presidential election of 1972, which saw Richard Nixon (1913-94) soundly defeating the anti-war platform of George McGovern (born 1922). Golub had adopted an active stance against the Vietnam conflict for almost a decade at the time these works were made; he joined the anti-war group Artists and Writers Protest on his return to the United States in 1964 after living for several years in Europe. However until this series he had not directly addressed contemporary issues in his work. The Vietnam paintings marked a move in Golub’s work from more ambiguous, classically inspired images of masculinity and power (see Fighter, 1965, Tate P77249) to a more pointed and abrasive political engagement with subject matter which has continued in his work to the present day.

The composition of Vietnam II is polarised. On the left side of the painting are three uniformed American soldiers in front of an armoured car. All three men brandish machine guns, two of which are pointed towards a group of Vietnamese men, women and children huddled on the far right of the image. Behind the civilians are what appears to be the charred remains of a makeshift building; wooden posts and bits of corrugated iron are covered in a thin, sooty wash of paint. A large expanse of bare canvas divides the two groups of figures. The aggression on the faces of the American soldiers is countered by the combination of horror and stoicism in the expressions of the Vietnamese figures, particularly a young boy positioned in the foreground of the image whose face acts as the focal point for the right side of the composition. He stares directly out of the picture, implicating the viewer in the action.

The dynamic postures of the figures were sourced from contemporary news photographs. Golub has described his working process, saying, ‘I begin by projecting drawings or parts of photographs onto the canvas – each figure is a synthesis of different sources ... I want each figure to be both the reconstruction of a generic type and to possess an idiosyncratic singular existence. The figures are first outlined and shaded in black. The second coat emphasizes three dimensionality and designated highlights. I apply local colour to define skin, wood, metal, cloth. The canvas is put on the floor and paint areas are dissolved with solvent and scraped. The main scraping tool is a meat cleaver. Once the canvas has been scraped down, eroded – a process which frequently takes two weeks – I reconstruct the figures’ (quoted in Michael Newman, ‘Interview with Leon Golub’, Leon Golub: Mercenaries and Interrogations, pp.5-6). The process of scraping embeds areas of colour deep in the grain of the support and gives the surface of the painting a rough texture.

The painting is executed on unstretched linen, and hangs directly on the wall from grommets positioned at regular intervals along the top of the canvas. Hanging loosely in this manner, the painting is suggestive of an unfurled banner or an animal hide. Along the bottom edge, three irregular forms have been cut away from the painting. These jagged excisions echo the violence depicted in the image in an assault on the fabric of the artwork.

Golub originally planned to give the Vietnam
paintings the collective title Assassins. In re-naming the paintings he not only situated the depict",1.0,1.0

In 1968 he had made a drawing of the phrase RAW WAR, exploring its potential as a palindrome where words read the same in reverse order. In this drawing, WAR is written three times on three lines: in the first line only the letter R is coloured, while W and A remain transparent; on the second line the A is coloured; while on the third all three letters are coloured in. The possibility of reading WAR as RAW thus appears as the eye travels from the top right hand corner of the page to the bottom left. Nauman had been exploring what he calls 'front/back interplay' in his sculptural work with fibreglass, inverting forms and focusing on the insides of moulds. He discovered through printmaking (particularly lithography) the automatic reversal of his initial image/text, which naturally fed into the front/back interplay of works like Raw-War. This provided an important new medium for his investigation into language as a system of signs. 'I am really interested in the different ways that language functions. That is something I think a lot about, which also raises questions about how the brain and the mind work … the point where language starts to break down as a useful tool for communication is the same edge where poetry or art occurs.' (Nauman quoted in Cordes, p.25) 

Shortly before making the lithograph, Nauman had produced a neon sign, Raw War, which flashes alternately RAW in red and WAR in orange. The lithograph reproduces this colour order, although in a more ambiguous manner, since the dominant word in the print RAW, which is coloured red, yields an inverted last letter 'r' if read in the normal manner, i.e. from left to right. Similarly the word WAR behind it must be read back to front, as a mirror image. Both words and the scratchings behind them disrupt normal ways of reading, although they are all recognisable as text. Nauman's skilful disruption of a simple relationship between the two words - they cannot be reduced merely to mirror-imaging - puts into question our own reading of their connection. The formal (in the form of the words) and conceptual (war as a situation of wounding, producing rawness) links between the two words are made clear. But the hierarchy of cause and effect is not. Produced during America's involvement in the Vietnam War, it could be read as a comment on the futility of that engagement.

The title of this print refers to the shooting of student 
demonstrators by the National Guard at a demonstration against 
American involvement in the Vietnam war held on the campus of 
Kent State University, Ohio in May 1970.  The image is derived 
from a photograph of a television screen during a BBC news 
broadcast on the day of the shootings.  The circumstances of the 
making of this print and the decision to make a large edition 
have been described by the artist as follows:

    Multiple printings, with the involvement of several 
    printers, hand-workings, and very large amounts of time 
    often spread over months, means that each copy of an edition 
    of seventy or so will be costly to produce and expensive to 
    buy.  The likelihood is that the edition will be sold at a 
    reasonable price when published; as the prints change hands 
    later prices can become absurdly high.
         
Just at the time that I was becoming aware of the 
    economic problems inherent in the publication of small 
    editions, Dorothea Leonhart, a Munich dealer, proposed to 
    publish prints in very large editions.  It seemed a good 
    moment to try to cut across the situation that had developed 
    in the print market.

This picture was painted in Ferrara during the war at a time when de Chirico was serving as a clerk in the Italian Army, but was able to resume painting in his spare time partly in barracks, partly in furnished rooms and hotels, and partly in military hospitals. It is one of three still-life paintings made at this period with maps and with a loose 'scaffolding' of forms in the background, the others being 'Politics' and 'Evangelical Still Life', both of which are signed and dated 1916. On style it would seem to be the last or the last but one of the three.

A. Bates has noted that the map in 'Evangelical Still Life' (now in the Museum of Modern Art, New York) is the same as the one in Carlo Carr?'s 'Metaphysical Muse' of 1917 and that the latter shows more of the surrounding area, which makes it possible to identify the site as the Istrian Peninsula just south of Trieste and containing the towns Fiume and Pola. On the other hand, the maps in 'The Melancholy of Departure' and 'Politics' have not been identified, and it seems very probable that the one in this work (which includes a dotted line indicating the route of a sea or lake voyage) is purely imaginary.

The theme of travelling is recurrent in de Chirico's works of about 1913-16 and there are several earlier paintings of piazzas and colonnades, with trains puffing s",1.0,1.0
