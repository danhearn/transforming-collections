A young woman (Jati) who is a family planning field worker visits the chief administrator of a village to make sure that she is welcome there. With the information she is given, she identifies a family to visit to discuss contraceptive advice. She meets the mother of three young children and agrees to a meeting. The field worker recommends that children are paced two or more years apart as the mother has been unwell and the youngest baby is failing to thrive. The mother has a visit from her mother-in-law and another woman who are a bit sceptical; Jati agrees to return later and speak to the mother with her husband. A young couple with less money discuss the issues around having a large family. The field worker shows the couple the different methods of contraception and ascertains the level of interest for each type. She leaves some literature and a paper fan as a souvenir of the visit. She next visits a woman fitted with an IUD; the woman reports a few side-effects and Jati notes them down. Jati returns to the first house and tells the husband about pacing pregnancies. The traditional 'dukun' or midwife passes the field worker and they greet each other amicably. The fieldworker writes up her notes. Field workers meet together and debrief each other on their experiences.</p>",,1121.0,,,,https://wellcomecollection.org/works/vfy3by4c,Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0)
