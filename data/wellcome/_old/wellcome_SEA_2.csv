In a rural community in Indonesia, there is a puppet show to communicate the message to children and in youth clubs in tandem with cultural activities in order to promote the idea of small families being the social norm. In a factory in Malaysia, young female workers have a lecture on contraception at lunchtime. In a post-natal clinic, new mothers are given advice. There is a mobile clinic which travels around Kuala Lumpur. At a rubber plantation, family planning advice is provided alongside general medical care. In Singapore, already densely populated, the focus is on the young - teachers are lectured to provide information to their pupils. Young people living in hostels are found to be lacking in understanding human reproduction and family planning - they receive lectures too. Thailand also has a significant population problem especially around the shanty towns around Bangkok - night time film shows and clinics are provided to this community. Local health visitors visit rural families in their homes. Local community distribution advisers disseminate information to the rural poor; they have a more challenging task of communicating the desirability of smaller families to these communities.

Jean Wright is our narrator. The film has a highly melodramatic (and rather intrusive) music sound track. The young boy has a high fever and is being nursed by his mother. A glimpse of traditional life is shown. Later, in the health clinic, we see public health posters of the day on the walls, re-inforcing messages about TB etc. The young woman is seen assisting the nurse in her clinic.

We see research into Malaria and visit a Leper colony in Malaysia. In Bangladesh WHO work has eradicated smallpox and we see how having a healthcare centre in Cuba has been hugely beneficial. In Sudan a solar pump is providing villagers with clean water, unpoluted water while in the Philipines poluted water leads frequently to Schistosomiasis.

But confidence was shaken even before the end of that decade with the death of seven workers at a polio vaccine laboratory from Marburg's virus. In 1969 the deadly lassa fever, whose viral source is the rat, was brought to Britain from Sierra Leone. From 1976 onwards, outbreaks of disease caused by the highly infectious ebola virus killed hundreds in Africa. Increasing global travel meant that no disease could be confined to its country of origin. The Heathrow Health Control Unit screens immigrants for tuberculosis. Russia and Eastern Europe are badly affected by TB and the multi drug resistant strain can flare up anywhere in the world. Conference visitors to the US came home with Legionaires disease. Travel within cities on over crowded transport may spread disease. Animals are a chief source of infection: an influenza like illness originating in chickens was passed to humans in Hong Kong in 1997 and a disease originating in pigs killed those working with the animals in 1999 in Malaysia, both outbreaks necessitating the slaughter of the countries chickens and pigs. In Britain, children caught e-coli related illnesses from farm visits. AIDS, identified in 1980, has killed 16 million people. War, trade and travel exported it from Africa and the Western lifestyle encouraged it to flourish. The HIV virus mutates to evade control by drugs and there is still no prospect of a vaccine.</p>

SITES AND SOURCES FOR LOCAL HISTORY
</p><p>
There were several sites used by the Wellcome Foundation and by Coopers, McDougall Robertson.  The following gives a good indication of sites for which material can be found but is not exhaustive:
</p><p>BRITAIN
</p><p>*  Beckenham - site of the Wellcome Physiological Research Laboratories from 1921, 'Langley Court'.
</p><p>* Berkhamsted - this was the main office and works site for Coopers, McDougall Robertson the veterinary medical supplies company.  The Cooper family were prominent in local society and economy and there are many specifically personal and local history items held in the archive.
</p><p>* 'Brockwell Hall', Herne Hill - site of the Wellcome Physiological Research Laboratories from 1897 -c.1921.
</p><p>* Dartford Chemical Works from 1888- previously 'Phoenix Paper Mills', the site included 'Kepler Wharf'. Nearby was the 'Wellcome Club & Institute'.
</p><p>* Euston - The Wellcome Building 183 Euston Road, originally 'The Wellcome Research Institution' later called the 'Wellcome Building', from 1932.  Also Unicorn House - the Head Office of the Wellcome Foundation from 1990.
</p><p>* Frant - the Veterinary Research Station, it consisted of Ely Grange & manor House, with several farms.  The most well-known farm was 'Tyburn Farm' where 'Code Name Operation Tyburn' (research into Scrub Typhus) took place during WW2.
</p><p>* Snow Hill - the Head Office site near Holborn Viaduct.  Various offices were used from 1879 when Burroughs arrived in London, however the company settled in one set of offices until they were bombed in WW2.
</p><p>*  Wandsworth - 'Bell Lane Wharf' the site of the first factory from 1883.
</p><p>
</p><p>
OVERSEAS
</p><p>
Both Wellcome and Coopers were international companies from very early in their histories with offices and sales agents across the globe.
</p><p>
The circa dates given are from the establishment of subsidiary companies, though both companies had dealings in the countries from before these dates.  So although Ireland and Spain only gained subsidiary companies late in Wellcome's history, these countries had been targeted from the 1880s.  Some of the cities where the main offices were based are also indicated:
</p><p>* Africa - Egypt, Ghana, Kabete, Kenya (1955), Nairobi, Nigeria, South Africa (1902 - East London, Johannesburg), Tanzania (1974), Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe
</p><p>*  America - Argentina (1910), Brazil (1955), Canada (c1906), Caribbean, Cuba, Mexico (1967), USA (1906 - New York; Greenville; Tuckahoe; Research Triangle Park),
</p><p>* Asia - Arabian Gulf (1977), Ceylon (1976), China , Hong Kong (1972), India (1912), Indonesia, Iran (1973), Japan (1971), Jordan, Korea, Kuwait, Malaysia (1968), Nepal, Pakistan (1956), Philippines (1968), Saudi Arabia, Shanghai (1908), Singapore (1968), Syria, Taiwan, Thailand (1972),
</p><p>* Australasia - Australia (1886 - Sydney), New Zealand (1954)
</p><p>*  Europe - Austria (1972), Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Finland, Germany (1967), Greece, Holland (1967), Hungary, Ireland (1972 - Dublin), Italy (Milan 1905), Malta, Monaco (1964), Norway, Portugal (1973), Russia, Spain (1966), Sweden, Switzerland (1978), Turkey
</p><p>* In addition Wellcome's work on the Wellcome Research Laboratories (later the Wellcome Tropical Research Laboratories) at Gordon College, Khartoum in the Sudan are also well documented - particularly in Wellcome's correspondence (see WF/E/01).
</p><p>
</p><p>
COOPERS
</p><p>
Coopers had a strong connection with countries that had large sheep or cattle herds (hence little connection with Asia).  Those with no dates in brackets were formed as companies pre 1960:
</p><p>*  Africa - Kenya, Rhodesia, South Africa, Uganda (1971), Zambia (1969)
</p><p>*  America - Argentina, Paraguay (1969), Peru (1965), Uruguay, USA, Venezuela (1965)
</p><p>*  Australasia - Australia, New Zealand
</p><p>*  Europe - Belgium, France, Italy, Ireland, Spain</p>",,,,,,https://wellcomecollection.org/works/fy2n52en

<p><b>Contents</b></p>
<p>1. f. 1: Medical recipe, early 15th-century hand, faint.</p>
<p>2. ff. 2r-93r, Constantinus Africanus, <i>Viaticum</i>, in Latin, with <i>Glosule</i> by Geraldus Bituricensis.</p>
<p>The medical <i>summa</i> traditionally called <i>Viaticum</i> or <i>Breviarium</i>, as in the present manuscript, is a Latin adaptation by Constantine the African (c. 1020-1098/9) of a standard medical manual in Arabic, entitled <i>Kitab Zad al-musafir wa-qut al-hadir</i> (i.e. <i>Provision for the Traveller and the Nourishment of the Settled</i>) composed by the Abu Ja'far Ahmad ibn Ibrahim ibn abi Khalid al-Jazzar (Ibn al-Jazzar) (d. 979 or 1004-5), the famous physician of Qeirwan (al-Qayrawan, Kairouan) in Tunisia, who had been a pupil of Ishaq ibn Sulayman al-Isra'ili (fl. c. 855-955), known in Europe as Isaac Judaeus. Most of Ibn al-Jazzar's work was lost, but the <i> Kitab Zad al-musafir </i> survived having been translated into Greek during his lifetime. Constantine's adaptation followed the 'a capite ad calcem' order of the original work and was written in the 1070s or 1080s at Montecassino, from where it was widely disseminated throughout Europe mainly by means of manuscripts copied in Benedictine scriptoria.</p>
<p>Constantine's version was conceived as a concise textbook intended for Latin readers, and primarily for the medical school of Salerno. Therefore it remained close to the Arabic original in terms of structure and contents, but differed in length and identification of sources, favouring ancient Greek and Hellenistic references rather than Arabic sources. The <i>Viaticum</i> was taught at medical faculties during the 12th and 13th centuries and was particularly popular in France, as documented by a number of commentaries written within French medical circles up to the 14th century: see Mary Frances Wack, <i>Lovesickness in the Middle Ages. The 'Viaticum' and Its Commentaries</i> (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1990), pp. 31-35; Mirja Martha Brachtel, <i>Ibn al-Jazzar's </i>Zad al-Musafir<i> and Constantinus Africanus' Latin Version </i>Viaticum Peregrinantis<i>: A Comparative Study</i> (Master's thesis, International Islamic University, Malaysia, 2005) [available online at https://www.academia.edu/7595021/IBN_AL-JAZZ%C4%80RS_Z%C4%80D_AL-MUS%C4%80FIR_AND_CONSTANTINUS_AFRICANUS_LATIN_VERSION_VIATICUM_PEREGRINANTIS].</p>
<p>The present manuscript is a copy of the vulgate tradition of the <i>Viaticum</i> (the cataloguer is grateful to Dr Brian Long for the information).</p>
<p>The <i>Glosule</i> represent the first surviving full commentary on the <i>Viaticum</i> by Gerardus (Geraldus, Girard) Bituricensis (of Berry), a French physician operating in Paris between the late 12th and early 13th century; he compiled his glossa probably drawing from direct teaching experience and at the request of his Parisian colleagues: see Ernst Wickersheimer, <i>Dictionnaire biographique des médecins en France au moyen âge</i> (Geneva: Droz, 1936), vol. 1, p. 203; Danielle Jacquart, <i>Supplément</i> (Geneva: Droz, 1979), pp. 92-3; Wack, <i>Lovesickness in the Middle Ages</i>, pp. 51-56.</p>
<p>The texts are listed in eTK, A digital resource based on Lynn Thorndike and Pearl Kibre, <i>A Catalogue of Incipits of Medieval Scientific Writings in Latin</i> (Cambridge, MA: Mediaeval Academy, 1963; with supplements in 1965 and 1968; online at https://medievalacademy.site-ym.com/?page=Books#etk), nos 817D (main text), 1298H (prologue), and 325J (Gerardus's commentary).</p>
<p>For other manuscript copies of Constantine's Latin text in the Wellcome Library, see MSS 208 (imperfect), 209, 547 (ff. 55r-103v; imperfect), 730 (f. 23r; extracts); for copies of Gerardus's commentary see MSS 305, 535 (ff. 61r-120v).</p>
<p>Both Constantine's text and Gerardus's commentary were printed for the first time in 1505 in Venice, together with other works by Gerardus: <i>In hoc volumine continentur, Introductorium iuuenum Gerardi de Solo.

Oxana Malaya was left outside by her alcoholic parents as a toddler, so crawled into a kennel for warmth and spent more time with dogs than humans, so grew up behaving more like a dog than a child.  Dramatic reconstruction illustrates the story of Victor, the first scientifically recorded case of a wild child, discovered in France in 1800.  The experiments of Winthrop Kellogg and Harry Harlow, both involving the early development of monkeys, are briefly covered.  The case of Jeannie Wiley is explained in detail: she was discovered as a 13-year-old in a house where she had been kept in total isolation by her parents, strapped to a potty chair by day and kept in a cage at night.  She was unable to walk and was never spoken to, so was unable to speak.  Child Psychologist James Kent and Professor of Linguistics Susan Curtiss talk of their work with Jeannie.  In the Ukraine town of Mirny, a 4-year-old boy called Edik who grew up with stray dogs is now living with a foster family.  James Law, Professor of Language and Communication, visits Edik to evaluate his prospects.  Although, with help, rehabilitated feral children are gradually able to empathise and learn single words, they will not be able to learn spoken language and grammar past the age of 4 years.

</p><p>The Hong Kong Branch was set up in 1963. Contact lapsed in 1973 but was re-established in 1977. The 'Branch' became independent in 1978 while maintaining affiliation and their title became either The Hong Kong Society of Community Medicine or The Society of Medical Officers of Health, Hong Kong.

M Pelling's 'Handlist of Public Health Records', 1985, states that some records are in the possession of Dr S McClatchey. Efforts to locate them in 1998-1999 were unsuccessful.

This proposal was discussed in 1925. The Malayan Branch appears in the journal's Branch elections list for the sessions 1925/26 through to 1933/34. It is not known what happened to the Branch after this date.  A Malayan Branch re-appears in the election lists for 1956/57. The editorial of <i>Public Health</i> Nov 1956, Vol 70 No 1, p21, states that a new Branch in Malaya was 'coming into being' and Vol 71 No 3, Jun 1957, p117, contains a report of the 'birth' of the Malayan Branch, Nov 1956. It is not known when this Branch ceased to exist.  No records in this deposit.
</p><p>Southern Australia Branch: <i>Public Health</i> Nov 1900, Vol 13 No 2, p134 contains an extract from the <i>Australian Medical Gazette</i> reporting the recent formation of a Society of Medical Officers of Health in Adelaide, which would be known as the South Australian Branch of the Incorporated Society of Medical Officers of Health in England.

The first meeting was held in Sep 1900 at which the president, T Borthwick, gave an address on 'The outbreak of plague (so-called) in South Australia, from a personal standpoint'. The Branch was dissolved by the Council of the Society, at the request of members, in 1903.  No records in this deposit.
</p><p>The South Indian Branch existed at least from 1925-1934. <i>Public Health</i> Dec 1923, Vol 37 No 3, p68, states that the Society had received an inquiry from Medical Officers of Health in the Province of Madras, India, regarding formation of a local Branch of the Society. The Executive Secretary was directed to consult members of the Society in India in reference to this proposal. The South Indian Branch appears in the journal's Branch elections lists 1925/26-1933/34. It is not known what happened to the Branch after this date. No records in this deposit.</p>",,,,,,https://wellcomecollection.org/works/umrcr445

He also did important work on Kala-azar, the differentiation of tropical fevers, snake-venoms, the treatment of tuberculosis, and the animal diseases of rinderpest and surra.  He was instrumental in bringing about the foundation of the Calcutta School of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, and was a founder member of the British Empire Leprosy Relief Association.  He also played a significant part as a propagandist for the Research Defence Society.  He made important studies in epidemiology, in particular the relationship between climate and disease, with specific reference to India.  He received numerous honours and distinctions.  His publications were very many and diverse (see E/1).
</p><p>Considerable arrangement of the papers had already taken place and it was clear that after Rogers's retirement from service in India he had given much attention to the preservation of the record of his work, by the preparation of summary notes of the contents of his diaries and by the editing of his diaries to make them more legible and bring out the events of significance and by the arrangement of correspondence.  Most of the correspondence and notes deposited by Rogers with the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine had been arranged into bundles by subject, with introductory notes and lists of contents (and in some cases attached indexes).  Most letters also include a brief note added by Rogers giving the correspondent's name and the main subject.  This arrangement has been retained but an index to correspondents has been prepared .  Besides the subject groups of papers there is a small group of letters to and from individuals which seem to have been principally of personal interest to Rogers.
</p><p>Although Rogers's own arrangement of the papers has been retained as far as possible, since they were deposited originally over a period of time it has not been possible to be completely consistent in the allocation of materials to particular sections of the list; for example some of the items in A.55 complement material to be found in Section C.</p>",,,,,,https://wellcomecollection.org/works/y2tveeg4

Also included are some non-Society records such as public health literature, 1902-1991, and files relating to the journal <i>The Medical Officer</i>, 1897-1973.
</p><p>Section L comprises over 200 files, covering the 1950s to 1990s, relating to comments and evidence produced by the Society, which illustrate the extent of its activities and importance as an advisory body and source of specialist knowledge. Accordingly, it also provides a wealth of information on various public health topics, which supplements that contained in the Society's journal <i>Public Health</i>. The collection includes Vols 3-89 of the journal, covering 1890-1975, and incomplete volumes up to 1994. As well as being a medium for the publication of scientific articles and discussion of contemporary issues, <i>Public Health</i> stands as an important record of the Society's proceedings, role and policies. As a research tool it is equal in importance to much of the primary material in the collection and often fills in gaps in the latter. Records representing some of the Society's early activities in the emerging public health field are listed in Section K.
</p><p>Records of the Society's Branches, Regions and Groups form a major part of the collection. Branches and Groups were entitled to conduct their business independently of the central body and therefore records were not kept at Society headquarters. Many had to be located and retrieved by the Secretary and the Oxford Unit from former secretaries or members, local health authorities and libraries in the 1970s. A number of records, particularly of Branches, have been permanently placed in local repositories. Although the majority of Branch and Group records are listed or accounted for in Sections N and P and Appendices 1-2, some gaps still remain. Efforts made in 1998-1999 to trace additional material were largely unsuccessful, and it is likely that some papers are held in unknown repositories and privately, or have simply been destroyed. What has survived varies greatly in content, quantity and quality. This can be attributed to the level of activity, efficiency of the Secretary and custodial history. Records mainly comprise minute books and files maintained by the local or group secretary and the Society Secretary. Some minute books include transcripts of papers read, correspondence, menu cards, photographs and other ephemera, giving a broader picture of activities, e.g. Northern and Yorkshire Branches (N.8 & 15) and the School Health Service and Services (Hygiene) Groups (P.9 & 10).
</p><p>Records of the Society's Faculty of Community Health, including minutes and publications, are listed under Section Q, but they suffer from a number of gaps.
</p><p>Section R comprises a rich collection of secondary sources which vividly document and illustrate public health measures, policies and issues chiefly in the first half of the 20th century.</p>",,,,,,https://wellcomecollection.org/works/p4zrhhvm

The barge was used by King Mongkut to proceed the ceremony for distribution of the Lenten robes. The photograph probably shows the barge after the ceremony had been completed, when the barge was moored in a klong. The prow is adorned with many dragons' heads. The rowers have their paddles raised skywards, demonstrating the ""bird in flight"" stroke. A similar scene to Thomson's negative number 608, but all the rowers are looking towards the camera and the picture is sharp. Should be combined with Thomson's negative number 609 (showing the rear half of the barge) for the full view. For further details see Paisarn Piemmettawat, loc. cit.</p>","J. Thomson Pho.r

In Asia the Thailand/Cambodia border is the epicentre of the disease. Thousands of Thai prospectors seeking precious stones in the border area return home with the malaria parasite in their blood. Self-medication then gives rise to drug resistant malaria. Dr. Nicholas White (University of Oxford) forecast disaster for these countries unless incentives are provided for research into new treatments. The best hope, meanwhile, seems to lie in an ancient chinese plant remedy for cerebral malaria. The film also looks at Thailand's battle against AIDS, begun too late to stem the epidemic. Funding for malaria treatment has fallen off in favour of research into an AIDS vaccine - although malaria is by far the greater killer.</p>",,,,,,https://wellcomecollection.org/works/h9ks3pp8

He has a very rare genetic condition which also makes his joints swollen - walking is very painful. The van Ness family are the tallest family in Britain; every member is well above average including the mum and dad. Craig Glenday, editor of the Guinness Book of World Records travels to Thailand to meet 17-year-old Marley who is possibly the tallest woman in the world. She has a tumour on her pituitary gland and unless it is treated she will continue to get taller - as her family is so poor they can't afford the medicine unless she earns money from her status as the tallest girl in the world. Angelique Cooper is, at 8-years-old, the height of an average 10-year-old. She's inherited her height from her father who is 6,10."" He is concerned that she will inherit his large height and takes her to see Professor Noel Cameron in order to predict her future height. A Jamaican girl, Marvadine, is 15-years-old and is 6,9"" tall; her sister is just 4 inches shorter.</p>",,,,,,https://wellcomecollection.org/works/axwg33d4

The water supplies of small Chinese towns were infected with laboratory-grown bacteria as an experiment and samples were taken from victims who were then murdered.  Chinese men were also rounded up for use in germ warfare experiments, which included anthrax spores, bubonic plague and glanders.  The Japanese also set up germ warfare centres in Manchuria, Thailand and Singapore.  Throughout the 1940s they field-tested bombs containing anthrax spores and even collected plague-infected fleas which were packed into bombs and dropped over China.  Britain experimented with anthrax in 1942 on the island of Gruinard.  There is film of these experiments, in which sheep were used to test the spread and toxicity of the anthrax organism.  However, germ 'bombs' were never put into mass production in Britain.  Japanese efforts to produce a war-winning weapon were finally defeated by the US atom bomb; and after World War II germ warfare research became a serious business in the US.  That country gave an undertaking that it would be for defence purposes only, but elsewhere in the world biological weapons research was directed towards aggressive as well as defensive ends, with Iraq causing current concern over its holdings and their potential use.</p>",,,,,,https://wellcomecollection.org/works/tch5ukd7

The programme begins with the tragic story of Gwen Araujo who was murdered by a group of young men, two of which were former lovers, when they discovered she was a male. Transsexuals Calpernia Addams and Andrea James who run a website for transsexual people discuss their sexuality. Max Beck, born a hermaphrodite (intersex), tells how he was raised a girl but later on while settled in a lesbian relationship decided to begin to live as a male. Professor Maria Patino was disqualified as an Olympic athlete when blood tests revealed her to be a 'man' despite her living her life since birth as female. We see Noah, a 10-year-old transsexual child and his family trying to come to terms with his sexuality. Louis Gooren in Amsterdam talks about latest research into brain scans of transsexuals. We also hear about transsexuality in different cultures - a young Indian man becomes a woman, and in Thailand so-called 'lady boys' talk about how their transsexuality has affected their lives. The programme ends by looking again at the aggression transsexuals are frequently confronted with. Lester Wright narrates the findings of his 1996 study to assess how much of homophobia might be an aggression stemming from the denial / self-deception of the homophobe towards their own ambiguous sexuality.</p>",,,,,,https://wellcomecollection.org/works/hw6wv7dn

It appears to have been instigated after the demise of the 'Guard Book' - volumes containing examples of product literature c.1880-c.1950 (see WF/M/GB).  However, there are some items in this 'later' series surviving from before 1950.  It forms an extraordinarily complete set of pharmaceutical product literature for the late 20th century (c.1950-1990).  The collection includes some high-profile products for key drugs, such as Daraprim (anti-malarial) or Zovirax (anti-viral), and popular over the counter remedies such as Actifed or Calpol.
<p>
The majority of the series is from the original collection, and remains in its original order (A-Z by Product name).  Some additional loose items of product literature were incorporated as part of the sorting process upon arrival at the Wellcome Library in 2002.
</p><p>
For each product listed there are varying numbers of surviving literature.  The 'Extent' shows the number of producible items (i.e. how many folders).  Where less than 6 pieces of product literature survive these are given as sub-items.  E.g. 1 Item (2 sub-items).  If no subitems are indicated the researcher can assume there is a substantial amount of material surviving.
</p><p>
The type of literature varies as to whether the product was a prescription or 'over the counter' product.  Marketing and press packs survive for some products.
</p><p>
Prescription drugs have technical information leaflets which were for use by the medical profession (usually accompanying the pills in their packaging).  Some packaging also survives - these tend to be simple boxes with a standard corporate design and text.
</p><p>
Over the counter products contain advertising material aimed at consumers.  These are often visual, with images associated with a particular brand, logos, pamphlets, posters, 'educational' advertising aimed at individuals or parents.  Packaging also survives and this tends to be more vibrant than the prescription drugs - with clearly specific brand designs.
</p><p>
Products were marketed throughout the world, including:<br>
Europe - Croatia, England, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Norway, Portugal, Russia, Spain, Sweden, Yugoslavia; <br>
Asia - Burma, China, India, Indonesia, Lebanon, Pakistan, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand; <br>

Languages included: mainly in English, but also in Arabic, Chinese, Danish, Dutch/Flemish, Finnish, German, Italian, Japanese, Norwegian, Portuguese, Russian, Serbo-Croat, Spanish and Swedish.

Sometimes included are small complimentary marketing items given to medical staff - such as post it notes, pens, note pads, magnets, window stickers, coasters, window/point of sale display boards, magic writing tablets and other small 'executive toys'.

The WHO was first alerted by Dr. Carlo Obani of Hanoi who was alarmed at the symptoms of one of his hospital patients.  Dr. Obani was unaware that the virus was already spreading through the hospital and in a short time, 60 patients died from it.  Dr. Obani also became fatally infected.  There had been rumours of a fatal disease spreading through Guandong, China, but China issued no warning and took no action.  By the time the urgency of the situation was recognised, the virus had already spread across the border to Hong Kong and from Hong Kong its route was open to the rest of the world.  At WHO Headquarters, Geneva, the Global Awareness and Response Unit took the unusual step of implementing its war plan.  As well as Hong King and Vietnam, Singapore and Canada were already experiencing cases of SARS.  This was the name give to it by the WHO.  They announced a worldwide alert and sent out guidelines to hospitals.  Even as they were setting up these precautions, new cases were identified in Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand and Germany.  It was an urgent matter to identify the virus so the world's top microbiologists were asked to co-operate with each other in the search.  The index case - the first person to contract the illness - was identified, Dr. Jianlun Liu, a Chinese doctor, who had carried the virus to Hong Kong.  Method of tranmission was established and a breakthrough occurred with the isolation of the virus from a patient.  It proved to be a corona virus which normally causes nothing worse than the common cold in humans, but this one had changed; probably an animal virus, it was likely that it had jumped species in Guandong, China, where people live at close quarters with their livestock.  The human immune system is unprepared for the onslaught of new virus and the results can be lethal.  There is no antidote for SARS; patients can be supported but ultimately the strenght of their immune systems resovles the battle one way or another.  Four weeks after the start of the outbreak the WHO had identified the virus and its likely origin.  But the disease was still spreading and there was doubt as to whether the WHO was in control of the outbreak.  As panic mounted, however, the WHO's tactics began to take effect.  Countries co-ordinated their resistance; Singapore screened everyone entering and leaving the country; hospitals screened patients, doctors and visitors and in Toronto 10,000 people were asked to go into voluntary quarantine.  A medical team in Canada cracked the virus's genetic code and the virus was found to be barely mutating (unlike the HIV virus).  If it remains stable there is a chance of developing a vaccine - but not in the near future.  China's outbreak proved to be far greater than the country had admitted, but even so, the worst is now know about SARS and its death rate is lower than in severe outbreaks of influenza.  The task is now to contain it within China, with the aim of eradicating it.  This programme was filmed in Hanoi, Guandong, Hong Kong, Geneva, Ontario and Toronto.

r8ye8yxz,b20015641,WF/M/PB/01,,Company-wide Newsletters & Journals (internal),,Archives and manuscripts,76 items,,,,1942 - 2000,,,,"Series of internal newsletters or journals produced for company-wide distribution.
<p>
The company-wide newsletters and journals existed as follows:<br>
'Foundation News' 1942-1986<br>
'Wellcome Journal' 1987-1991<br>
'Wellcome World' 1992-1995<br>
The publication of a journal exclusively for the Wellcome company ceased upon merger with Glaxo in 1995.  This sequence does, however, include copies of Glaxo Wellcome staff newsletters, 'Glaxo Wellcome World', 'Magnet' and the 'Glaxo Wellcome Post' (for Glaxo Wellcome pensioners).
</p><p>
A card index to the  'Foundation News' and 'Wellcome Journal', was created c.1980-89, covering the years  1951-1989.   It has been reproduced below  (the original is catalogued as WF/M/PB/01/01/43).  However, the Index is of selected subjects only.  If a possible news item does not appear in the index but the date is known (such as a retirement) a manual check of the publication would be worthwhile.
</p><p>
Arranged alphabetically by subject, giving date of edition and page number for each reference (for the most part). The subjects include products, people working for or associated with the firm, locations in which the firm operated, and general subjects which the company was working on (for example 'immunology'). Once you have found the date of the publication you need, order it using the list which follows.
</p><p>
NOTES ON USING THE INDEX<br>
Indexed term is given in capital letters, in alphabetical order.<br>
Products are filed under trade name not generic names<br>
Wellcome Trustees are all under Wellcome Trust<br>
Reagents are under diagnostics<br>
People (if no individual card may be entered under local companies)<br>

They are a significant source for study of the development of Protestant missions in China (in particular the role of the medical mission and the introduction of Western medicine), and also provide evidence of the involvement of the missionaries with issues of British trade and diplomacy.
</p><p>MSS. 5827-5852: correspondence and papers, especially of the Revd Robert Morrison (1782-1834), missionary in China, 1807-1834; John Robert Morrison (1814-1843), Chinese interpreter, Colonial Secretary of the Hong Kong government; and Dr Benjamin Hobson (1816-1873), medical missionary in China, 1839-1859. The majority comprise personal and domestic correspondence of the Morrison and Hobson families and their friends, with less emphasis on official papers, although the collection includes letters on the Peacock expedition to Siam and Cochin China led by Edmund Roberts (1784-1836), United States merchant and diplomat, 1832 (MS.5830), and letters to Benjamin Hobson from leading missionaries. 1843-62 (MS.5839). Insight into missionary work in China can be gained in particular from the letters of the Revd. Robert Morrison.
MS. 7127: 'Domestic Memoir of Mrs Morrison', by the Revd. Robert Morrison, addressed to his children Mary Rebecca and John Robert Morrison (1814-1843), 5-7 January 1824. Mary Morrison, Robert's first wife, died of cholera at Macao on 10 June 1821. This memoir was compiled by Robert Morrison during the voyage home from China aboard H.E.I.C.S.

Unani Tibb is an Islamic medical tradition. Health and personality are influenced by a person’s unique combination of humours, or elements, and their relationship with the environment. Illness occurs when the humours become unbalanced. Treatment is tailored to suit the individual’s specific mix of humours.

<p>In 1801 Flinders had set out in the ship <i>Investigator</i> to circumnavigate Australia and produce a detailed survey of its coastline, especially the southern coast which was still unknown, for the British government. In June 1803 the survey was abandoned due to the poor condition of the ship. Flinders sailed for England on HMS <i>Porpoise</i> to get another vessel to continue the survey but was ship-wrecked on the Great Barrier Reef. He managed to navigate the ship's cutter back to Sydney and arrange the rescue of the marooned crew. He then attempted to return to England but had to stop at Mauritius for repairs in Dec 1803. At this time France and England were at war and Flinders was detained as a spy by the French Governor. Flinders wrote to Sir Joseph Banks who was able to influence the French government that he was a scientist and explorer, not a spy, and approve his release.  However, the French governor, General De Caen refused to release him and he remained a prisoner for six and a half years. After his release and return to England in 1810 he began working on his book <i>A Voyage to Terra Australis</i> but lived only one day after its publication in 1814.</p>",,,,,,https://wellcomecollection.org/works/wngb9kaw

Though not successful in reaching the peaks, Wollaston was awarded the Gill Medal of the Royal Geographical Society on his return. During the expedition he made many observations of the Amungme (Uhunduni) people, who came to see the British explorers in the belief that the latter were revenant spirits of the dead who would lead them to paradise. Ballard, 'A.F.R. Wollaston and the ""Utakwa River Mountain Papuan"" skulls', loc. cit., suggests that Wollaston surreptitiously cut off and took away the heads of Amungme people who had died of malaria or starvation as a result of leaving their homeland to go and see them.

Dr Anthony Gaspari, Chairman of the Department of Dermatology, University of Maryland ran tests on Dede and believed his condition was due to an infestation of a rare wart virus which had run out of control because of his extremely weak immune system. He wanted to treat Dede's condition with drugs  rather than surgery. However the medical team at Hasan Sadikin Hospital want to operate on Dede and the Indonesian government encourage a huge media circus and admit him to the hospital for an intensive 6-month period of surgery. The surgery is shown in some detail. Eventually Dr. Gaspari is invited to Indonesia to present his plan to help Dede without relying on surgery alone - the wart virus is so virulent it will grow back quickly despite surgery.

Thermal Infrared is found within the Infrared region on the electromagnetic spectrum.



The different colours in the images represent different levels of thermal energy being emitted from an object.



The imaging technology has been successfully used in animal studies to observe thermoregulation, their environment and behaviour, their population and habitat.

The komodo are a vulnerable species due to the poaching of their main food source. Originally they were native to Indonesia where they inhabited tropical monsoon forest, palm savannah and grasslands. 


They are the largest of the known living lizards growing up to 3 metres and weighing up to 80kg.

It has been reported that parthenogenesis has taken place within komodos at some english zoos. This was astonishing as the asexual method of reproduction is rare among vertebrates.

In this image the komodo uses their forked tongue to gather chemical information from the air and when it withdraws its tongue, these chemicals transfer onto the pads on the floor of the mouth, this is referred to as vomero-nasal sense.",,,['jwn2he4s'],Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0),"https://iiif.wellcomecollection.org/image/N0038379/full/300,/0/default.jpg",https://wellcomecollection.org/works/w966nx7x

Dede has two children but his wife left him due to his condition and his inability to work leaving their children to be being raised by his sister in the village. Dede's only income is as a performer in an Indian circus troupe, a psychologically cruel and physiologically painful means of supporting his family. Dr. A. Gaspari, Chairman of the Department of Dermatology, University of Maryland, visits Dede to attempt to diagnose Dede's condition. He takes biopsies, tests Dede's immune system and runs genetic tests on Dede's whole family. Gaspari favours medical treatment rather than surgical. Not so in the case of Ion from Rumania who has a similar condition to Dede and is operated on by Dr. Laskar in Bucharest to remove multiple warts from his hand, a procedure which has mixed results and may not provide long-term relief. Dr. Gaspari discovers that Dede's condition is caused by his very low immune system and a voracious wart virus. He devises a treatment that should lead to the complete disappearance of the warts but Dede does not take him up on the offer, preferring for the time being to continue working with the circus troupe.</p>",,,,,,https://wellcomecollection.org/works/uebkju8w

Television Service']",2016.,,,['English'],"<p>Presented by Professor Alice Roberts, this programme explores how recent research and genetic techniques have given us insight into the four distinct groups of humans who lived on the planet at the same time as ourselves; examining the complexity of human evolution. Roberts starts with the Neanderthals, travelling to Gibraltar where Prof Clive Finlayson of the Gibraltar Museum has been studying a cave system which contains the final refuge of the Neanderthals. Finlayson explains how the stereotypes regarding Neanderthals have been proven wrong  evidence shows they were not only very cultured, but even capable of abstract thought, an ability that was previously thought to be exclusive to Homo sapiens. Professor Chris Stringer of the Natural History Museum, who has spent the last 30 years investigating the similarities and differences between modern humans and Neanderthals, explains that the two groups shared much of the same behaviour. With master flint knapper John Lord, Stringer looks at the tools Neanderthals used, which were the result of an exchange of ideas between the two groups. These interactions between Neanderthals and modern humans also helped our ancestors learn how to deal with the colder temperatures outside Africa. Professor Svante Pääbo, a geneticist from the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, then recounts how the excavation of a small finger bone in a cave in Siberia led to his team discovering the genome of an entirely new human group, which they called the Denisovans. So did modern humans come in contact with the Denisovans? The discovery of modern human teeth in Daoxian in China enabled archaeologist Dr Maria Martinón-Torres of UCL and her colleagues at the Chinese Academy of Sciences to date the move out of Africa at around 100,000 years ago. This means that our ancestors would have been living in Asia and Europe at the same time as Denisovans and Neanderthals. Anthropologists Dr Laura Shackelford and Dr Fabrice Demeter then recount the discovery of the third extinct human group, Homo floresiensis, in the small island of Flores in Indonesia. This species were nicknamed hobbits due to their small size, the result of island dwarfism. But since so many human groups have been discovered, Professor Roberts asks the pressing question  why did Homo sapiens survive, when all these other groups died out? Professor Stringer discusses the environmental factors that led to the extinction of Neanderthals, and Dr Janet Kelso of the Max Planck Institute explains how the lack of genetic diversity would have been a major factor as well. However, genetic research has allowed us to realise that present-day human beings actually share some DNA with these extinct groups, which Dr Kelso explains was the result of interbreeding. Her team were able to analyse DNA from people all over the world and concluded that those from within Africa generally lacked Neanderthal DNA, whereas people living outside of Africa often did have it as their ancestors had come in contact with Neanderthal groups. They even found traces of Denisovan DNA, particularly among Papua New Guineans, Aboriginal Australians, and Tibetans. Most recently, a fifth Hominin group was discovered by Professor Joshua Akey, a geneticist at the University of Washington. Very little is known about this group as no fossil evidence exists, and thus far they are known simply as an Archaic African group whose DNA can only be found in some parts of central Africa. Professor Roberts explains that all of these recent discoveries have forced us to completely reimagine our linear view of human evolution, and that genetics has made a huge difference to the study of our species.</p>",,,,,,https://wellcomecollection.org/works/gtkgeqzk

This part looks at how the way we inhabit the earth is leading to mass extinction and how we've struggled to understand and accept the full implications of Darwin's legacy. Marr looks back at how Darwin's theory of natural selection upset the Victorian people of his tme and led to his fears at publishing his research. However, in the Indonesian jungle, naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace was reaching similar conclusions to Darwin. He wrote to Darwin and Darwin was finally impelled to publish. Following this, Ernst Heckel founded the science of ecology; Wallace noted the way in which extinction could be induced by the interference of man rather than being a natural part of evolution. Darwin's final book was on worms and showed how vital the earthworm is to our lives. The effects of industrialisation led to huge concerns about our changing relationship with nature; William Morris, in particular, campaigned to save the beauty of the English countryside. But it wasn't until the arrival of moth enthusiast James W Tutt that Darwin's theory was connected to the effect of industrialisation on evolution. His discovery showed that in industrialised areas, the black version of the peppered moth survived and increased, while the paler variety became extinct. This provided proof that the behaviour of humankind on their environment could directly influence the path of evolution. Other ecological studies ensued, leading to Rachel Carson's publication of 'Silent Spring,' which looked into the dangers of pesticides; a book now regarded as the original battle cry for the modern environmental movement. James Lovelock expanded Darwinian theory to describe a global ecosystem based on biological feedback. He called this the Gaia hypothesis. This coupled with the first view of our planet taken from the surfaceof the earth, led to the beginnings of environmentalism.</p>",,,,,,https://wellcomecollection.org/works/efs6djnt

Having expressed a curiosity to see this individual, the King politely sent him over to our dwelling some days ago, and Dr. Wallich and I took down on the spot the following account of himself and his history. His name was Shwe-Maong, and he stated himself to be thirty years of age. He was a native of the district of Maiyong-gyi, a country of Lao, situated on the Saluen, or Martaban river, and three months' journey from Ava. The Saubwa, or chief of the country, presented him to the King as a curiosity when a child of five years of age, and he had remained in Ava ever since. His height was five feet three inches and a half, which is about the ordinary stature of the Burmese. His form was slender, if compared with the usually robust make of the Hindoo-Chinese races, and his constitution as rather delicate. In his complexion there was nothing remarkable, although upon the whole he was perhaps rather fairer than the ordinary run of Burmese. The colour of his eyes was a dark brown, not so intense as that of the ordinary Burman. The same thing may be said of the hair of the head, which was also a little finer in texture, and less copious. The whole forehead, the cheeks, the eyelids, the nose, including a portion of the inside, the chin—in short, the whole face, with the exception of the red portion of the lips, were covered with a fine hair. On the forehead and cheeks this was about eight inches long ; and on the nose and chin, about four inches. In colour, it was of a silvery grey ; its texture was silky, lank, and straight. … Our draftsman made very faithful sketches of the father and youngest child, to which I refer. After making the party presents, they took their leave of us, extremely grateful for our attention. Shwe-maong, we found, had been occasionally employed by the Court as a buffoon, having been taught to imitate the antics of a monkey. For these feats, however, the poor fellow does not seem to have been very liberally rewarded ; for, to subsist himself and family, he was obliged to betake himself to the trade of a basket-maker, in which he was now employed. He would have turned his monstrosity to better account in London.""--Crawfurd, op. cit., pp. 318-323</p>",Profile of a man covered with hair. Drawn by W.E.

<p>
""The out-break of war in the Far East with the movement of large numbers of troops into the battle areas presented the Allied High Command with many problems in the combatting of infectious diseases.  In many parts of the Far Eastern war zone scrub typhus was endemic with the result that jungle warfare against the Japanese in Burma and other areas produced a great increase in the incidence of the disease."" [p. 1]
</p><p>
""The request from the Army High Command for a sufficient quantity of vaccine to be prepared to carry out extensive trials in troops engaged in combat areas carrying a risk of scrub typhus meant that 1½ million doses of scrub typhus vaccine would be required.  The preparation of this quantity of vaccine was outside the resources of the National Institute for Medical Reseach.  As the result of inquiries by the Ministry of Supply among the leading pharmaceutical manufacturing firms in Great Britain, the Wellcome Foundation agreed to undertake the production....  It was decided to recruit a team of scientific workers from civilian and service personnel available in the country and to appoint a civilian scientific director responsible to the Wellcome Foundation for the direction of the scheme.
</p><p>
""The project was given the highest operational priority with the secret code name of 'Tyburn'.""  [pp. 2-3]
</p><p>
The project involved the construction of an extensive animal housing facility in Sussex.  The cotton rat, initially transported from America, was used to develop the vaccine.</p>",,,,,,https://wellcomecollection.org/works/d9h4mtux

A single minute book for one of the Association's local affiliated organisations, the Cambridgeshire Tuberculosis After-care Association, 1916-1935,  is also included.",,,,,,https://wellcomecollection.org/works/atgpc733

<p>
Letterbook consisting of copies of internal and external letters sent by the head office of Burroughs Wellcome & Co, Snow Hill, March - June 1903.
</p><p>
Topics covered in this letterbook include the day-to-day running of the business, with detailed correspondence with the Burroughs Wellcome productions site in Dartford and also the branches in Sydney and Cape Town.  Iinternal correspondence covers such administrative details as terms of employment and recruitment.
</p><p>
There is also correspondence with Burroughs Wellcome's Travelling Salesmen, such letters include discussion on such topics as sales techniques, the opening of new markets, the threat from rival companies and BW&Co products over which complaints have arisen.
</p><p>
This letterbook also contains material on the case of Burroughs Wellcome & Co v Thompson and Capper (referred in the letterbook to the 'Manchester case').  The case was brought about after BW&Co accused Thompson and Capper of manufacturing and selling their own pills as Tabloids, and so infringing on BW&C's trademarked term.
</p><p>
The letters to Henry Wellcome himself - written to him whilst he was on holiday - are  detailed and offer a good summary of the range of issues covered in the rest of the volume.  A great deal of these letter concern the 'Manchester case'.
</p><p>
Also included is correspondence with various publications over their infringement of BW&Co's 'Tabloid' trade mark.

A number of letters were acknowledged by HSW's secretary whilst HSW was on an extended visit to the USA and Mexico, closely followed by a visit to Europe.  A number of the letters received during this period were from America - presumably people whom HSW met on his travels.  Many of the replies to meetings were to proffer apologies for HSW's absence.  Sudlow was given Power of Attorney in HSW's absence - see 372.  The contact address for HSW during his travels was c/o Messr Fairchild Bros. & Foster, New York.
</p><p>
A number of letters re the purchase of furniture are signed by 'C. Irish &Co.' 'Irish' is referred to in other correspondence by HSW [employed as general handyman for the business?].

Please note the Wellcome Research Laboratories (WRL) in Khartoum were later called the Wellcome Tropical Research Laboratories (WTRL).

Presenting in front of a live studio audience Rosling discusses poverty around the world and global efforts to deal with this problem. The main premise of the show is examining the United Nations 2015 Millennium Goal 1.1 aiming to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030. After questioning the audience on their perceptions of poverty, Rosling explains the difference between ‘relative’ and ‘extreme poverty’ and uses projected graphs, diagrams and statistics to demonstrate his points on the history of poverty and the relative decline since 1800. Footage of a family from Malawi serves as a case study into people living in extreme poverty. A young family from Cambodia serve as another case study into a family who can enjoy some basic luxuries due to a growing economy.</p>",,,,,,https://wellcomecollection.org/works/qzz7j9a8

The documentary is part of a BBC series; ‘Why Poverty?’ and is a cross-media event, spanning 70 broadcasters in 180 countries. The main focus of the series is; why do one billion people globally live in poverty? The documentary opens by posing the question ‘Is it worse to be born poor or die poor?’ Following the pregnancies and births of four women, all of whom would be defined as poor within their respective countries, the documentary discusses the ‘birth right lottery’; depending on your country of birth, the opportunities available to you, whether you are going to thrive or struggle, depends on where you were born. The documentary follows Starr, a 37 year old married mother of four living in San Francisco, California. Although her baby Billy-Jean has a life expectancy of 78, the United States has one of the worst child mortality rates in the developed world. Starr is shown attending the San Francisco Prenatal Programme, set up by Martha Ryan 22 years previously. In its first year the programme had taken into its care 72 expectant mothers; this year that number had reached 517. Ryan believes that this is evidence of a growing gap between those who have and those who have not in American society. The program then moves to Sierra Leone where Hawa is expecting her fifth child. According to the documentary, nineteen of the twenty worst countries to be born into are situated in Africa; Sierra Leone is at the bottom of the table. According to statistics, in Sierra Leone the average life span is just 49 and the country suffers from a high child mortality rate. Visiting the Gondama Referral Centre, Dr Philip De Almada and Dr Claire Fotheringham tell of their aim to reduce the maternal mortality rate by 75%; from 1 in 8 to 1 in 25. Dr Fotheringham worked out that it cost as little as €1.7 per mother for their treatment and care. Dr Almada believes that the world is rich enough but it is a question of redistribution of that money. The documentary then travels to Cambodia where Nuang is seen with her two children. Her older son must collect empty bottles and cans for money as they have no other source of income. Nuang’s adopted daughter was abandoned at one month; she is now five, living in Cambodia means that she is more likely to suffer malnutrition than go to high school. Recently in Cambodia pregnant women are now offered free health care, unfortunately Nuang’s third baby; LyLy dies at just two months from unknown causes. Finally the film follows Lisa, 22, a single parent living on benefits in the final stages of her second pregnancy; her daughter Grace was born two years previously. Out of all three women Lisa is the only one that appears relatively happy with her life, saying that although people may have more than her, she is happy with what she has got. Of all four countries the UK has the longest life expectancy, many living to see their 100th birthday. The programme attempts to give a worldwide perspective on poverty, revealing the real losers in the birth right lottery. The film has rather shocking footage featuring scenes of still births and statistics about child mortality.</p>",,,,,,https://wellcomecollection.org/works/tfew5r2q

As a member of the League, he undertook various advisory international missions, where he provided recommendations and guidance to governments on public health matters, such as the control of cholera, typhus fever and small pox.

<p>His first mission as Secretary of the Malaria Commission of the League of Nations was in Greece, advising on a pandemic of dengue. Mackenzie made recommendations to the Greek government on how to control the epidemic and how to prevent a recurrence. In 1929, he returned to Greece to carry out a general survey of the country from a public health perspective, including the study of the incidence of infectious disease in all parts of Greece.

</p><p>Between 1929 and 1930, Mackenzie visited Bulgaria to conduct a survey on areas by syphilis. While in Bulgaria, he met government officials to discuss the current conditions and environment and produced a report based on his findings.

</p><p>In 1930, Mackenzie was sent by the League of Nations to Bolivia to make recommendations for the reorganisation of the country's health services. In order to do so, MDM conducted a survey over a nine month period, focusing on diseases in the tropics of the Amazon, including malaria and dysentery. Between 1931 and 1932, Mackenzie travelled to Liberia as Special Commissioner to the Council of the League of Nations.

</p><p>In 1936, acting as Director of the Epidemiological Bureau of the League of Nations, Mackenzie visited Singapore to manage outbreaks of plague and cholera. As part of the League of Nations Eastern Bureau, Mackenzie collated reports from nearby countries providing local details of the existence of epidemics such as cholera and plague. This information was then distributed by the League of Nations to ship captains, pilots and doctors in ports, in order to prevent the transmission of infectious diseases between countries.

</p><p>In 1938, the League of Nations responded to a request from the Chinese Government to collaborate in epidemiological work, particularly for the prevention of cholera, small pox, typhus and malaria in the region. Mackenzie visited the country between 1938 and 1939 to report and advise on outbreaks of diseases triggered by the Sino-Japanese war.

This section falls into two main groups of letters. Firstly there is a group of letters B.1-B.23 from various individuals with whom ESS was associated and with whom he had a considerable amount of correspondence. It is not clear what criteria were employed in selecting out this group while other correspondents of importance have been left in the alphabetical sequence. This group has been arranged chronologically by the date of the earliest item. It should be noted that the William Sharpey material includes a number of Sharpey's own papers which were saved from destruction by ESS, as well as letters from Sharpey to ESS. The second group B.24-B.65 consists of correspondents arranged in alphabetical sequence. Although most correspondents in this series are represented by a mere one or two letters some corresponded with ESS over quite some period. For ease of handling and reference the series has been divided up into 65 files with the general reference PP/ESS/B. Each letter within each file has a number of its own. Letters from ESS's pupils Sanger BROWN and Sutherland SIMPSON are to be found under AMERICAN COLLEAGUES.

The custom is very much alive in Singapore and you can find film of tang-ki ceremonies on YOUtube: the chairs are often shown but the version with sword blades is only shown for a moment on one. Photographs of tangki show body piercing with long skewers, striking the body with a spiked ball, tongue cutting and slashing the body with swords -- all without permanent damage, and all to show the superhuman powers of the god in the medium. As well sword- or nail-chairs, mediums sometimes climb sword ladders. ...

Unfortunately many of their letters were hand written and very few carbon copies survive. Very occasionally an attempt at methodical selection and arrangement is evident: on the whole correspondence had been kept in alphabetical order, and this has been retained in the arrangement of the collection. Dorothea and Charles’ correspondence was fairly mixed (reflecting their working life together) with the exception of two distinct groups: correspondence about Dorothea’s research on alchemical manuscripts, and later correspondence about her hearing aids.

</p><p>The main part of the collection centres on the correspondence; this has been grouped together in a self-evident sequence: writings and biographical personal papers follow. Certain of Dorothea’s papers remained clearly distinct and these have been kept together. Section E contains a variety of material relating to Jewish refugees, which had been placed on one side by Dorothea after the war for permanent preservation. It has not been listed in detail but sorted into three broad categories. The last section, comprising additional correspondence of the Singers with Sir Zachary Cope, Sir Arthur Salusbury MacNalty and Dr F.N.L. Poynter, is not strictly part of the collection, but these groups of correspondence were given to the Institute to be placed alongside the Singer papers.</p>",,,,,,https://wellcomecollection.org/works/uk9yt2sv

The description below applies to the entire original volume, which is now spread across two microfilms (AMS/MF/174 and AMS/MF/175).  Please order both films to be sure of finding material listed below. **
<p>
Letterbook consisting of copies of internal and external letters sent by the head office of Burroughs Wellcome & Co (BW&Co), Snow Hill, December 1881 - May 1897.
</p><p>
This was a joint business letter book - with letters by Wellcome, Burroughs and the key senior managers Kirby and Sudlow.  There are significant overlaps with WF/E/01/01/01 from August 1882.
</p><p>
The Letterbook includes letters illustrating the breakdown in the business relationship of Burroughs and Wellcome (eg referring to each other as ""Mr..."" in internal memos that are being sent to each other in the same building) and also letters on the aftermath of Burroughs's death.
</p><p>
A great deal of the correspondence relates to trade and sales, whether it is the gift of BW&Co products to notable names and institutions (eg Cecil Rhodes; British Army) or the relationship with BW&Co sales agents across the world.
</p><p>
Other topics covered in this letterbook include the day-to-day running of the business, including the move of BW&Co production from Wandsworth to Dartford and the breakdown of Wellcome's working relationship with Dr Otto Witte, Foreman and Chemist at the Wandsworth works.
</p><p>
Insights are also offered into how Henry Wellcome dealt with management isssues (see Mrs GUSLLAGON).

The description below applies to the entire original volume, which is now spread across two microfilms (AMS/MF/174 and AMS/MF/175).  Please order both films to be sure of finding material listed below. **
<p>
Letterbook consisting of copies of internal and external letters sent by the head office of Burroughs Wellcome & Co (BW&Co), Snow Hill, December 1881 - May 1897.
</p><p>
This was a joint business letter book - with letters by Wellcome, Burroughs and the key senior managers Kirby and Sudlow.  There are significant overlaps with WF/E/01/01/01 from August 1882.
</p><p>
The Letterbook includes letters illustrating the breakdown in the business relationship of Burroughs and Wellcome (eg referring to each other as ""Mr..."" in internal memos that are being sent to each other in the same building) and also letters on the aftermath of Burroughs's death.
</p><p>
A great deal of the correspondence relates to trade and sales, whether it is the gift of BW&Co products to notable names and institutions (eg Cecil Rhodes; British Army) or the relationship with BW&Co sales agents across the world.
</p><p>
Other topics covered in this letterbook include the day-to-day running of the business, including the move of BW&Co production from Wandsworth to Dartford and the breakdown of Wellcome's working relationship with Dr Otto Witte, Foreman and Chemist at the Wandsworth works.
</p><p>
Insights are also offered into how Henry Wellcome dealt with management isssues (see Mrs GUSLLAGON).

Please order the microfiche version quoting the reference AMS/MF/174 and AMS/MF/175. **
<p>
Letterbook consisting of copies of internal and external letters sent by the head office of Burroughs Wellcome & Co (BW&Co), Snow Hill, December 1881 - May 1897.
</p><p>
This was a joint business letter book - with letters by Wellcome, Burroughs and the key senior managers Kirby and Sudlow.  There are significant overlaps with WF/E/01/01/01 from August 1882.
</p><p>
The Letterbook includes letters illustrating the breakdown in the business relationship of Burroughs and Wellcome (eg referring to each other as ""Mr..."" in internal memos that are being sent to each other in the same building) and also letters on the aftermath of Burroughs's death.
</p><p>
A great deal of the correspondence relates to trade and sales, whether it is the gift of BW&Co products to notable names and institutions (eg Cecil Rhodes; British Army) or the relationship with BW&Co sales agents across the world.
</p><p>
Other topics covered in this letterbook include the day-to-day running of the business, including the move of BW&Co production from Wandsworth to Dartford and the breakdown of Wellcome's working relationship with Dr Otto Witte, Foreman and Chemist at the Wandsworth works.
</p><p>
Insights are also offered into how Henry Wellcome dealt with management isssues (see Mrs GUSLLAGON).

h6gn4ves,b20016736,PP/CED,,"Dent, Charles Enrique (1911-1976)",,Archives and manuscripts,33 boxes,,"['Metabolism', 'Physiology', 'Science', 'Education, Medical', 'Genetics', 'World War II', 'Starvation', 'Nutrition disorders']","['Dent, Charles Enrique (1911-1976)']",c.1940-1977,,,['English'],"<p>The vast majority of the material relates to Dent’s research and clinical interests and falls into four main categories: correspondence files; files created around the publication of papers; lecture notes and symposium papers; and case/research notes. There are also smaller quantities dealing with other aspects of his career, such as the administration of UCH Metabolic Ward.

</p><p>The papers thus reflect most of Dent’s scientific and clinical interests. This research is mainly represented by the abstracted documentation which he kept with drafts of his published papers (see section E.1) and also by correspondence about cases and clinical case notes (see section C.5). To a lesser degree they also illustrate the work at the laboratory bench which underpinned much of this research. For example, a file of unidentified paper chromatograms has been preserved (C.2/10) to illustrate one of Dent’s methods of working, as described by his colleague, Heathcote, and quoted in the <i>Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society</i>, 1978: ‘Paper chromatograms were not to be thrown away. They were filed and, since the colours faded, the outline of each spot was drawn in and the intensity of the colour was indicated by a number.’

</p><p>The way in which Dent compiled a large series of files around drafts of scientific papers also illustrates the importance of the published paper to him as a stage in the research process. In order to help make sense of the collection, a list of publications is therefore provided as a note to this collection description. An incomplete collection of reprints of Dent’s published papers may be found in section E.2 of the collection.</p>",,,,,,https://wellcomecollection.org/works/h6gn4ves

Shopkeepers are enlisted for education and information dissemination. A campaign to make the female contraceptive pill readily available was then rolled out. The film then looks at the situation in the Philippines. A family planning clinic was set up running alongside a church, Iglesia Cristo. Volunteers are shown preparing packs for distribution and then canvassing the clinic's facilities. The situation in Columbia is studied. A green flag is present outside distribution outlets for contraceptives. New adopters of contraception are called 'new acceptors'.

The vaccine would have been used to vaccinate French troops during the First World War. Preventing disease was essential to keep large numbers of troops healthy, especially when soldiers were living in close quarters.

Another example of folklore (from India) outlines how copper earrings were worn to ward off the demons of sciatica.

The film then goes on to discuss the criteria for success for establishing a clinic. Firstly, it needs to be located in a convenient place. The waiting area should be large (very many people are shown waiting). Other aspects of administration are seen (leaflets, posters etc). A group of women are shown waiting for a film to be  projected. An examining area has to be private and the facilities needed are shown. Some of the footage appears to be shot in a South American Spanish-speaking country. A vasectomy is seen through the operating room window. Patients are shown recovering from minor surgery. Female practitioners (ethnicity appears to be Indian) are shown. Procedures for disposing of post-examination supplies are described for the benefit of nurses and clinic staff. A mother and baby attending a clinic is then shown (ethnicity appears to be African). A male field worker speaks to factory workers promoting good family planning practices. Volunteers are trained. A mobile clinic with field workers is seen in action. Good practice and a respectful attitude to patients are encouraged.</p>",,,,,,https://wellcomecollection.org/works/zvdckt6a

Central vertical and horizontal creases from having been folded in quarters and stored. Small hole, affecting a letter but not sense or legibility; four other small holes, all marginal, not touching text.",,,,1818,,,['Spanish'],"Description taken from seller's description:

""In 1803, the Spanish government began a campaign to vaccinate everyone in all its Spanish territories. The story of the Royal Philanthropic Vaccine Expedition (the so-called Balmis Expedition), is well known as one the first large-scale international public health initiatives. By 1806, many hundreds of thousands had been vaccinated, from the Viceroyalty of Peru to China and the Philippines. The epidemic resurged in Spain over the next decade, and fresh mandates were issued, including ours, in 1818, ordering all children three months of age or older to be vaccinated. The preamble to the mandate suggests that the lower classes are inherently less caring for their children and therefore bear more responsibility for the spread of the disease. The seven articles of the mandate are as follows: <p></p>

<p> 1. All children of both sexes are to be vaccinated at three months of age. The parents or guardians of children whose constitutions are too weak to receive a vaccine must provide evidence to this effect from their doctors and submit it to the Board of Health. </p>

<p> 2. Those who do not vaccinate their children or wards as per the first article are subject to fines. </p>

<p> 3. Any child who contracts smallpox shall be quarantined in a room in their own home and cared for by someone who has been vaccinated or has already had the disease. If the child should die, the room will be chemically fumigated and sealed off. Those who contravene this article shall be fined. </p>

<p> 4. Anyone twelve or older who contracts smallpox and cannot be cared for at home shall be transferred to a lazaretto (smallpox hospital) until they recover, and may not leave until a doctor permits it. When transfer to a lazaretto is not possible, Article 3 will be in force. When quarantine at home is not possible,quarantine at an available (general) hospital will be enforced. Those who contravene this article shall be fined. </p>

<p> 5. Fines collected will be used to defray public health costs related to smallpox, to promote the vaccine, to pay for the cost incurred by members of the indigent population who contract smallpox,and to reward whistleblowers who reveal persons who are concealing the infected. </p>

<p> 6. If doctors or those in the medical establishment conceal or do not report instances of the illness, they will be subject to higher fines. </p>

<p> 7. The mandate does not supersede or abrogate laws already in place.The mandate (legally an edict) was signed by Francisco Javier Castaños Aragorri Urioste y Olavide, the 1st Duke of Bailén. Castaños, who later distinguished himself in the Napoleanic campaigns and then served as the first president of the House of Peers in Spain.  Castaños is adamant in his goal of exterminating smallpox, and is clear that he will punish those who stand in the way: </p>

<p>  <i>Cometo al zelo de las Juntas de Sanidad y Justicias el exacto cumplimiento de cuanto contienen los articulos que anteced enesperando que lo desplegaran ahora y en lo sucesivo, hasta conseguir eltotal exterminio de las viruelas, que por necesidad debe ser infalible, siel escarmiento reprime á los preocupados, y la persuasion convence a losque miran con indiferencia sus mismos hijos y el interes general de sus conciudadanos. Y para que llegue noticia y nadie pueda escusarse con la ignorancia , he mandado expedir el presente Edicto rmado de mimano y refrendado por el Secretario de S. M. y de esta Capitania General. Barcelona 23 de Mayo de 1818.</i> </p>

After her official retirement she continued her involvement with the  National Association for Mental Health, but was also able to extend her interests by working for the Save the Children Fund and other organisations, and these activities are also reflected in the collection.

</p><p>There are, however, many gaps in the papers.  While RSA's early training and research are covered, her pre-War work in child guidance and during the Second World War are represented mainly by lecture notes and publications.  Her long career in the NAMH is chronologically well covered from 1950 onwards, but the quantity of material is not great and it can be assumed that most of the papers were retained in the Association's internal filing system. With certain exceptions most of the papers representing RSA's other activities date only from the 1960s onwards and it is impossible to say what proportion of the total survives.  The sequences of lecture notes and publications, do, however, seem to be fairly comprehensive.</p>",,,,,,https://wellcomecollection.org/works/yef8epmt

The origins of British paediatric work were to be found in the political background:  the United States of America requested some show of support (of its presence in Vietnam) by Britain.  The then Prime Minister, Mr Wilson, sought advice from the Ministry of Overseas Development which suggested the scheme of supporting a childrens teaching hospital.  Dr Evans was asked to visit Saigon as an adviser by the Ministry of Overseas Development (on the announcement of which he lost his appointment as Consultant Paediatrician to the Army).

This part features clinical scientist and doctor, Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust. For 18 years he ran the Oxford University Clinical Research Unit in Ho Chi Minh City studying and directing research in infectious diseases. He then became director of the Wellcome Trust and this is briefly introduced in terms of its size and impact, particularly internationally. Jeremy Farrar talks about his early life growing up in various countries around the world and how he became interested in clinical research during his time at university. Working as a doctor in the 1980s and experiencing treating people in the early days of HIV transmission had a profound impact on him and his decision to pursue a career in infectious diseases. He talks about his decision to go to Vietnam in 1996. Whilst he was there he was at the centre of dealing with SARS and H5N1 bird flu outbreaks which he elaborates. The first cases of H5N1 were diagnosed at the hospital in Ho Chi Minh City and Jeremy Farrar discusses how it felt to be there. He talks about how dealing with both diseases affected him, personally and professionally, and made him aware how local disease outbreaks affect us all globally. His time building up the research unit in Ho Chi Minh City is discussed, including what he hoped to achieve. There are contributions from two colleagues, HIV researcher Thuy Le in Ho Chi Minh City, and Nick White, professor of tropical medicine in Bangkok. Jeremy Farrar talks about the culture of research in Asia, and Vietnam in particular including how the politics there affect health research. The Wellcome Trust is then considered. He mentions the scope he has, as a new director, to reprioritise the direction of research should he wish to, particularly in support of international health in its broadest context. He talks about medical research funding areas generally and considers key areas of the Trust that are likely to be critical in the coming decades. These include, genomics and how this will work in areas of medical research, the brain and mental health, infectious diseases especially in relation to drug resistance, and sustainability of health and how we live, including the medical humanities. He talks too about climate change and how it is linked with societal changes. He thinks the Trust has been very forward thinking in working in the area of culture, society and the humanities in relation to science. Finally he talks about what he misses from Vietnam and in no longer being a doctor.</p>",,,,,,https://wellcomecollection.org/works/gqscwz6g

Doll found as much as a fifty-fold increase in risk for smokers. Larry Beason has studied non-smokers to find out if industrial pollutants is associated with lung cancer. Doll is accused of downplaying the effects of industrial pollutants or pesticides. Attempts have been made to establish a connection between Agent Orange and medical problems in Vietnam veterans.

Behind the scenes, however, the Chinese government had already decided to throw in its lot with the Americans as against the Russians, who were perceived as the greater threat. After the two bloody border conflicts between the Soviet Union and China at Zhenbao (Damansky) Island in March and August 1969, there were reports that the Soviets were considering a pre-emptive nuclear strike against China: four marshals advising Mao Zedong emphasized the need for Beijing to prepare for a ""worst-case scenario"". President Nixon, after his election in 1969, declared his wish for America to have good relations with all countries, not excluding China. His remarks were taken up by Mao, leading to a secret visit to Beijing by Dr Henry Kissinger in July 1971 and an open one in October 1971, laying the foundations for President Nixon's visit in February 1972. In the negotiations with the United States Mao stressed the necessity of American withdrawal from Vietnam. The posters therefore reflect Chinese fears of nuclear attack by the Soviet Union, presented for propaganda purposes as fears of attack from the USA (Chen, op. cit., pp. 240-244; Yang, op. cit.)</p>","San fang changshi: yuanzi, huaxue, xijun wuqi de fanghu",,"['ens64qbm', 'pfzxt7cw', 'tseptrxa', 'wejsppfw', 'vv3r38c5', 'a5zqv8th', 'g7cx7t3b', 'kcvrp7hf', 'h7trgz42', 'sn8cuenk', 'w4j8bqfz', 'ewhhr78e', 'ghqem2ta', 'wwxu5pa8', 'cpn8z36e']",In copyright,"https://iiif.wellcomecollection.org/thumbs/B16605676_0001.JP2/full/!200,200/0/default.jpg",https://wellcomecollection.org/works/z2avkryh

Section A, entitled 'Laboratory notes' is a compilation of Sir Harold Himsworth's experimental work on diabetes and liver function and disease. Series 1 and 2 comprise his experimental notebooks on experiments carried out on animal and human subjects. Some of the records in A/2 have therefore been restricted or closed to due the sensitive nature of the material regarding the human subjects. Series 3 entitled 'Research papers' is a mixture of experimental notes, calculations and notes which again has been restricted due to sensitive content. The final part of section A, 'Collected Articles' is a series of published academic articles written by Himsworth which cover both his experimental work and his role within the Medical Research Council. </p>

<p> Section B relates to his role as Secretary of the Medical Research Council from 1949 to 1968. The bulk of this section is comprised of collected annual reports from this era along with specialist publications on the affect of nuclear weapons and another on CS gas that Himsworth was actively involved in producing. The rest of the series is comprised of memorandum, correspondences and related articles associated with his role as secretary of the MRC. Additionally, B/4 is a series of notes that Himsworth compiled whilst touring the African MRC stations in 1951. </p>

<p> Section C covers all the collected papers regarding the Northern Ireland enquiry on the affect of CS gas launched after the public outcry of the use of the gas in Londonderry in 1968. This section contains correspondence that Himsworth received and sent debating the toxicity of the gas, with several letters and enquiries being received from the US and France relating to its use within the Vietnam conflict and the Paris Riots. There is a full series of official minutes from the committee and a large assortment of scientific articles relating to CS gas with a separate section relating to French research and reports. </p>

<p>  Section D entitled 'Social Science Research Council' is the collected papers, minutes and itineraries relating to the Social Science Research Council (SSRC) Warwick Conference, 1968. Amongst the reports there are several review papers on the state of anthropology, sociology and psychology research in Britain. </p>

<p> Section F comprises of  'University College Hospital: War Time Reforms to Medical Education' with papers, reports, articles and correspondences related to Sir Harold Himsworth's interest and campaign to reform medical education during the first few years of the Second World War. </p>

<p> The last section, G, is a general assortment of items that were personally collected by Sir Harold Himsworth. G/1 is split between medical history articles and miscellaneous scientific articles; G/2 are the collected obituaries that Himsworth collected over his lifetime; G/3 are draft and printed public addresses by Sir Harold and the final item is a copy of his philosophical publication <i>Scientific Knowledge and Philosophical Thought </i>. </p>",,,,,,https://wellcomecollection.org/works/zw7meuaa

How does it happen? These pigs have some special immune system. FROGS, too, can heal themselves from serious abdominal wounds, even when in a squalid tank. Michael Zazlov, was astonished by his frogs, whose wounds did not fester, and has discovered they have chemicals at the wound site - an antibiotic he has called 'meganin'. He is trying to exploit this commercially. Do animals have special knowledge about medicinally useful plants. Manuel Arguillan investigated chimps eating the Aspinia plant with its hairy leaves rolled up. He found antibiotics which may affect nematodes. Richard Rangam disagrees and thinks the hairy leaf traps nematodes in the gut, so it is a physical effect, not chemical. George Lazano is totally sceptical as there are no controlled experiments. Andrew Wighton studies gorillas eating the Venonia plant. It is possible that generations of a successful species have selected some plants prophylactically.</p>",,,,,,https://wellcomecollection.org/works/p2xxd3pv

According to BAT’s Scientific Director David O’Reilly, the nicotine contained in e-cigarettes is no more harmful than a cup of coffee – a claim refuted by leading paediatrician Sir Cyril Chantler, who cites the drug’s addictive properties.  The rise of e-cigarettes has outpaced regulation, prompting a return to previously banned marketing outlets including sports sponsorship, television commercials and product placement in music videos. Mike Daube from the Australian Council on Smoking on Health is in no doubt; e-cigarettes are ‘a weapon of mass distraction’ and marketing dream for tobacco companies. The UK’s largest brand, E-Lites, sponsor Worcester Warriors rugby club. Taylor challenges the company’s Chief Executive, Adrian Everett, accusing him of normalising smoking. Yet e-cigarettes have helped many smokers to quit. In a deprived area of Derbyshire, where smoking rates are double the national average, GP Dr John Ashcroft has set up his own shop to sell the products.  As yet, there is no direct evidence that e-cigarettes are a gateway to smoking for young people. But the anti-tobacco lobby are finding it hard to trust an industry that has lied and disassembled for so many years. Meanwhile in the developing world where 80% of smokers live, marketing restrictions are limited or non-existent. Taylor travels to East Timor, the country with the highest smoking rate for men in the world. Jorge Luna of the World Health Organisation says that smoking rates amongst young people are rising year on year. Taylor interviews the country’s Prime Minister Xanana Gusmão, who has no plans to introduce legislation, despite his Australian wife’s role as an anti-tobacco campaigner for UNESCO. In East Timor’s schools, children as young as 10 smoke openly. Taylor considers the history of cigarette adverting. The world’s biggest tobacco company Phillip Morris has recently launched a controversial new campaign, ‘Be Marlborough’, aimed unashamedly at young people. The campaign was launched in Germany, where cigarette advertising is still permitted in cinemas. An internet campaign swiftly followed. Although Marlborough claims its models are over 30, their clothing and poses resemble those of teenagers. The campaign was subsequently banned by a German court, but has since been rolled out worldwide. Taylor journeys to Argentina, which has the highest rates of smoking in South America. While the country has signed up to the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, it has never been ratified. The industry is quick to exploit loopholes in legislation, expanding point of sale displays to permit extensive advertising. Although smoking is not permitted in public places, the law is not enforced. Argentina is the second largest tobacco producer in South America, which may explain the industry’s relative freedom. In neighbouring Uruguay, the climate is rather more hostile. The country has the most stringent anti-smoking legislation on the continent, prompting Phillip Morris to sue for an estimated 2 billion dollars on IP grounds over health warnings on cigarette packaging. Former President and oncologist Tabaré Vázquez, who introduced the ruling, describes smoking as the worst pandemic that mankind has endured. Australia is fighting a similar legal battle, and BAT is primed to sue should plain packaging be introduced in the UK. The programme concludes with footage from Taylor’s previous documentaries on the topic, dating back 40 years.</p>",,,,,,https://wellcomecollection.org/works/pq84mnvm
