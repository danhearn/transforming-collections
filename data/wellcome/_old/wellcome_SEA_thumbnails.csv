<p><b>Contents</b></p>
<p>1. f. 1: Medical recipe, early 15th-century hand, faint.</p>
<p>2. ff. 2r-93r, Constantinus Africanus, <i>Viaticum</i>, in Latin, with <i>Glosule</i> by Geraldus Bituricensis.</p>
<p>The medical <i>summa</i> traditionally called <i>Viaticum</i> or <i>Breviarium</i>, as in the present manuscript, is a Latin adaptation by Constantine the African (c. 1020-1098/9) of a standard medical manual in Arabic, entitled <i>Kitab Zad al-musafir wa-qut al-hadir</i> (i.e. <i>Provision for the Traveller and the Nourishment of the Settled</i>) composed by the Abu Ja'far Ahmad ibn Ibrahim ibn abi Khalid al-Jazzar (Ibn al-Jazzar) (d. 979 or 1004-5), the famous physician of Qeirwan (al-Qayrawan, Kairouan) in Tunisia, who had been a pupil of Ishaq ibn Sulayman al-Isra'ili (fl. c. 855-955), known in Europe as Isaac Judaeus. Most of Ibn al-Jazzar's work was lost, but the <i> Kitab Zad al-musafir </i> survived having been translated into Greek during his lifetime. Constantine's adaptation followed the 'a capite ad calcem' order of the original work and was written in the 1070s or 1080s at Montecassino, from where it was widely disseminated throughout Europe mainly by means of manuscripts copied in Benedictine scriptoria.</p>
<p>Constantine's version was conceived as a concise textbook intended for Latin readers, and primarily for the medical school of Salerno. Therefore it remained close to the Arabic original in terms of structure and contents, but differed in length and identification of sources, favouring ancient Greek and Hellenistic references rather than Arabic sources. The <i>Viaticum</i> was taught at medical faculties during the 12th and 13th centuries and was particularly popular in France, as documented by a number of commentaries written within French medical circles up to the 14th century: see Mary Frances Wack, <i>Lovesickness in the Middle Ages. The 'Viaticum' and Its Commentaries</i> (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1990), pp. 31-35; Mirja Martha Brachtel, <i>Ibn al-Jazzar's </i>Zad al-Musafir<i> and Constantinus Africanus' Latin Version </i>Viaticum Peregrinantis<i>: A Comparative Study</i> (Master's thesis, International Islamic University, Malaysia, 2005) [available online at https://www.academia.edu/7595021/IBN_AL-JAZZ%C4%80RS_Z%C4%80D_AL-MUS%C4%80FIR_AND_CONSTANTINUS_AFRICANUS_LATIN_VERSION_VIATICUM_PEREGRINANTIS].</p>
<p>The present manuscript is a copy of the vulgate tradition of the <i>Viaticum</i> (the cataloguer is grateful to Dr Brian Long for the information).</p>
<p>The <i>Glosule</i> represent the first surviving full commentary on the <i>Viaticum</i> by Gerardus (Geraldus, Girard) Bituricensis (of Berry), a French physician operating in Paris between the late 12th and early 13th century; he compiled his glossa probably drawing from direct teaching experience and at the request of his Parisian colleagues: see Ernst Wickersheimer, <i>Dictionnaire biographique des mÃ©decins en France au moyen Ã¢ge</i> (Geneva: Droz, 1936), vol. 1, p. 203; Danielle Jacquart, <i>SupplÃ©ment</i> (Geneva: Droz, 1979), pp. 92-3; Wack, <i>Lovesickness in the Middle Ages</i>, pp. 51-56.</p>
<p>The texts are listed in eTK, A digital resource based on Lynn Thorndike and Pearl Kibre, <i>A Catalogue of Incipits of Medieval Scientific Writings in Latin</i> (Cambridge, MA: Mediaeval Academy, 1963; with supplements in 1965 and 1968; online at https://medievalacademy.site-ym.com/?page=Books#etk), nos 817D (main text), 1298H (prologue), and 325J (Gerardus's commentary).</p>
<p>For other manuscript copies of Constantine's Latin text in the Wellcome Library, see MSS 208 (imperfect), 209, 547 (ff. 55r-103v; imperfect), 730 (f. 23r; extracts); for copies of Gerardus's commentary see MSS 305, 535 (ff. 61r-120v).</p>
<p>Both Constantine's text and Gerardus's commentary were printed for the first time in 1505 in Venice, together with other works by Gerardus: <i>In hoc volumine continentur, Introductorium iuuenum Gerardi de Solo.

Large amounts of water will run-off large areas of roof to waste if it is not trapped. A small additional cost of guttering and a tank can supply a family with a source of water inside or close to the house.

This system relies on the roof being made from a suitable material such as corrugated iron. The use of rainwater for domestic purposes reduces human contact with natural water sources, such as rivers or pools, which may be contaminated with sewage or infected with parasites.",,,['xbvnubat'],Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0),"https://iiif.wellcomecollection.org/image/W0026578/full/300,/0/default.jpg",https://wellcomecollection.org/works/vtf6pheg

After visiting the principal cities in Europe they returned to America to settle as farmers in North Carolina, adopting the name of Bunker and marrying two sisters who bore each of them many healthy children.

Since the Treaty of Nanjing in 1842, the trade in Amoy (Xiamen) had grown considerably. The chief commodities in the area included tea, sugar and grain.

Thermal Infrared is found within the Infrared region on the electromagnetic spectrum.



The different colours in the images represent different levels of thermal energy being emitted from an object.



The imaging technology has been successfully used in animal studies to observe thermoregulation, their environment and behaviour, their population and habitat.

The komodo are a vulnerable species due to the poaching of their main food source. Originally they were native to Indonesia where they inhabited tropical monsoon forest, palm savannah and grasslands. 


They are the largest of the known living lizards growing up to 3 metres and weighing up to 80kg.

It has been reported that parthenogenesis has taken place within komodos at some english zoos. This was astonishing as the asexual method of reproduction is rare among vertebrates.

In this image the komodo uses their forked tongue to gather chemical information from the air and when it withdraws its tongue, these chemicals transfer onto the pads on the floor of the mouth, this is referred to as vomero-nasal sense.",,,['jwn2he4s'],Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0),"https://iiif.wellcomecollection.org/image/N0038379/full/300,/0/default.jpg",https://wellcomecollection.org/works/w966nx7x

Having expressed a curiosity to see this individual, the King politely sent him over to our dwelling some days ago, and Dr. Wallich and I took down on the spot the following account of himself and his history. His name was Shwe-Maong, and he stated himself to be thirty years of age. He was a native of the district of Maiyong-gyi, a country of Lao, situated on the Saluen, or Martaban river, and three months' journey from Ava. The Saubwa, or chief of the country, presented him to the King as a curiosity when a child of five years of age, and he had remained in Ava ever since. His height was five feet three inches and a half, which is about the ordinary stature of the Burmese. His form was slender, if compared with the usually robust make of the Hindoo-Chinese races, and his constitution as rather delicate. In his complexion there was nothing remarkable, although upon the whole he was perhaps rather fairer than the ordinary run of Burmese. The colour of his eyes was a dark brown, not so intense as that of the ordinary Burman. The same thing may be said of the hair of the head, which was also a little finer in texture, and less copious. The whole forehead, the cheeks, the eyelids, the nose, including a portion of the inside, the chinâin short, the whole face, with the exception of the red portion of the lips, were covered with a fine hair. On the forehead and cheeks this was about eight inches long ; and on the nose and chin, about four inches. In colour, it was of a silvery grey ; its texture was silky, lank, and straight. â¦ Our draftsman made very faithful sketches of the father and youngest child, to which I refer. After making the party presents, they took their leave of us, extremely grateful for our attention. Shwe-maong, we found, had been occasionally employed by the Court as a buffoon, having been taught to imitate the antics of a monkey. For these feats, however, the poor fellow does not seem to have been very liberally rewarded ; for, to subsist himself and family, he was obliged to betake himself to the trade of a basket-maker, in which he was now employed. He would have turned his monstrosity to better account in London.""--Crawfurd, op. cit., pp. 318-323</p>",Profile of a man covered with hair. Drawn by W.E.

</p><p>This is a vivid and amusing account,  ""written Summer 1945"", of life in the RAMC for a woman officer during wartime, although it ends rather abruptly with a vignette of the Officers' Mess in Singapore. She notes her thwarted hopes of undertaking research and the military emphasis on the correct completion of large amounts of paperwork.  The memoir is illuminating about the relationships between women in the RAMC and other women in the services (ATS, nurses, etc) and attitudes towards women as doctors in the military context.

As well sword- or nail-chairs, mediums sometimes climb sword ladders. ...

Behind the scenes, however, the Chinese government had already decided to throw in its lot with the Americans as against the Russians, who were perceived as the greater threat. After the two bloody border conflicts between the Soviet Union and China at Zhenbao (Damansky) Island in March and August 1969, there were reports that the Soviets were considering a pre-emptive nuclear strike against China: four marshals advising Mao Zedong emphasized the need for Beijing to prepare for a ""worst-case scenario"". President Nixon, after his election in 1969, declared his wish for America to have good relations with all countries, not excluding China. His remarks were taken up by Mao, leading to a secret visit to Beijing by Dr Henry Kissinger in July 1971 and an open one in October 1971, laying the foundations for President Nixon's visit in February 1972. In the negotiations with the United States Mao stressed the necessity of American withdrawal from Vietnam. The posters therefore reflect Chinese fears of nuclear attack by the Soviet Union, presented for propaganda purposes as fears of attack from the USA (Chen, op. cit., pp. 240-244; Yang, op. cit.)</p>","San fang changshi: yuanzi, huaxue, xijun wuqi de fanghu",,"['ens64qbm', 'pfzxt7cw', 'tseptrxa', 'wejsppfw', 'vv3r38c5', 'a5zqv8th', 'g7cx7t3b', 'kcvrp7hf', 'h7trgz42', 'sn8cuenk', 'w4j8bqfz', 'ewhhr78e', 'ghqem2ta', 'wwxu5pa8', 'cpn8z36e']",In copyright,"https://iiif.wellcomecollection.org/thumbs/B16605676_0001.JP2/full/!200,200/0/default.jpg",https://wellcomecollection.org/works/z2avkryh
