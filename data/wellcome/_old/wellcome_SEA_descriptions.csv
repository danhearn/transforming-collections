"Water and sanitation This woman is washing bowls next to rainwater catchment tanks in Thailand. Rainwater catchment is an underutilized source of pure water, either as a main method or as a supplement for drinking. Large amounts of water will run-off large areas of roof to waste if it is not trapped. A small additional cost of guttering and a tank can supply a family with a source of water inside or close to the house. This system relies on the roof being made from a suitable material such as corrugated iron. The use of rainwater for domestic purposes reduces human contact with natural water sources, such as rivers or pools, which may be contaminated with sewage or infected with parasites."

Unani Tibb is an Islamic medical tradition. Health and personality are influenced by a person’s unique combination of humours, or elements, and their relationship with the environment. Illness occurs when the humours become unbalanced. Treatment is tailored to suit the individual’s specific mix of humours. The seeds are shown here with nigella sativa seeds (A670308) also used in herbal medicine. maker: Unknown maker Place made: Indonesia"

Carts such as this one transpont agricultural crops from field to market."
"The komodo has been visualised using thermal infrared which allows us to see thermal energy or radiation more commonly referred to as heat. Thermal Infrared is found within the Infrared region on the electromagnetic spectrum. The different colours in the images represent different levels of thermal energy being emitted from an object. The imaging technology has been successfully used in animal studies to observe thermoregulation, their environment and behaviour, their population and habitat. The komodo are a vulnerable species due to the poaching of their main food source. Originally they were native to Indonesia where they inhabited tropical monsoon forest, palm savannah and grasslands. They are the largest of the known living lizards growing up to 3 metres and weighing up to 80kg. It has been reported that parthenogenesis has taken place within komodos at some english zoos. This was astonishing as the asexual method of reproduction is rare among vertebrates. In this image the komodo uses their forked tongue to gather chemical information from the air and when it withdraws its tongue, these chemicals transfer onto the pads on the floor of the mouth, this is referred to as vomero-nasal sense."
"Staple foods: maize This Indonesian woman is carrying a basket of maize and tropical fruits to market. Maize is the major staple food in parts of South America and some regions of Africa. Yellow maize is the only cereal to contain carotene, which is used by the body to produce vitamin A."
"This Indonesian woman is turning over and spreading out the rice harvest. Drying removes water from the grains. This prevents bacteria, moulds and yeasts from multiplying during storage. Drying also retards the enzymes which age food, and enables it to be stored for longer periods. Dried grain is lighter in weight and easier to handle."

"This vaccine was made by Laboratoire de l'Armée (the Army Laboratory) in Paris, France in 1917. The vaccine would have been injected through the skin and was intended to provide protection against a form of dysentery known as Flexner’s dysentery. Simon Flexner (1863-1946), an American bacteriologist, identified the bacteria that caused the disease while working in the Philippines in 1899. The vaccine would have been used to vaccinate French troops during the First World War. Preventing disease was essential to keep large numbers of troops healthy, especially when soldiers were living in close quarters. maker: Laboratoire de l'Armée Place made: Paris, Ville de Paris, Île-de-France, France"

Reverse of Handbill advertising Krao, a young woman with an unusually hairy body (though not as hairy as the poster illustrations suggested) who was found in the jungles of Laos in 1885 by Carl Bock. She was exhibited as the missing link, cashing in on the publicity of Charles Darwin's evolutionary theory and the victorian / edwardian fascination with freak shows. She appeared at the Royal Aquarium exhibition hall, Westminster on March 25th 1887. The leaflet shows Krao standing on a rock against rich, jungle foliage, wearing a loin cloth, her arms raised to chest level, around a plant."
"Health promotion material: posters This health centre in Vietnam has been decorated with posters about trachoma. The poster with the picture of a sun says 'Examine, treat medically and take medicine for trachoma to avoid blindness forever'. The red banner says 'The whole population should participate actively to have trachoma eye surgery to prevent blindness forever'. The posters were developed using local artists and were used as part of an International Trachoma Initiative (ITI) campaign."
"Health promotion banner This banner, which says 'The whole population should participate actively to have trachoma eye surgery to prevent blindness forever', has been pinned on the outside of a health centre in Vietnam. It is accompanied by a poster encouraging good practice in the prevention of trachoma transmission The poster shows a local female celebrity using water from a well to wash her face. This promotes the facial cleanliness message."
"Trachoma campaign materials: Vietnamese poster This poster, which is about good practice in the prevention of trachoma transmission, has been pinned on the outside of the reception room of a local health centre in Vietnam. The poster below the reception room sign shows a boy using water from a well to wash his face. This promotes the facial cleanliness message. It emphasises the need to reduce transmission via contaminated fomites such as face cloths. The slogan on the poster says 'wash your face clean with your own handkerchief'."
"These ophthalmologists are performing surgery on a patient with trichiasis in Vietnam. This surgery was atypical because it was conducted by ophthalmologists, whereas in other countries trichiasis surgery would be carried out by ophthalmic nurses. It is not usually necessary for ophthalmologists to do this straightforward operation, as a trained nurse or medical officer can carry it out. The expertise of an ophthalmologist is only required under special circumstances, for example when a patient has defective eyelid closure."
"Distribution of health promotion material Written health promotion materials are being distributed to members of this Vietnamese community, who have come for antibiotics to treat trachoma. Mass treatment days such as this are an ideal opportunity to spread health messages about environmental hygiene and facial cleanliness, which are necessary to prevent reinfection after treatment."
"Health promotion through song These Vietnamese children are singing a song about trachoma. The children were taught the song, and are singing it in the health centre. In the background, there are some educational posters about trachoma. Song can be a popular way of introducing health messages to children. Children may spread the message further if they sing to their family and community."
"Hookworm (Ascaris) is a soil-transmitted helminth (parasitic worm). It accounts for a major burden of disease worldwide. Most hookworm infections occur in Africa, the Americas, China and southeast Asia. The main way people become infected with hookworm is through direct skin contact with contaminated soil, typically when walking barefoot. The larvae and adult worms live in the small intestine (small bowel) of an infected person or animal."

"A film showing how family planning information is disseminated across the urban and rural populations in Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand. In a rural community in Indonesia, there is a puppet show to communicate the message to children and in youth clubs in tandem with cultural activities in order to promote the idea of small families being the social norm. In a factory in Malaysia, young female workers have a lecture on contraception at lunchtime. In a post-natal clinic, new mothers are given advice. There is a mobile clinic which travels around Kuala Lumpur. At a rubber plantation, family planning advice is provided alongside general medical care. In Singapore, already densely populated, the focus is on the young - teachers are lectured to provide information to their pupils. Young people living in hostels are found to be lacking in understanding human reproduction and family planning - they receive lectures too. Thailand also has a significant population problem especially around the shanty towns around Bangkok - night time film shows and clinics are provided to this community. Local health visitors visit rural families in their homes. Local community distribution advisers disseminate information to the rural poor; they have a more challenging task of communicating the desirability of smaller families to these communities. The injectable contraceptive which offers 12 week family planning is popular amongst some women."
"This is a fundraising film (and possibly a nursing recruitment film) by the British Red Cross Society. It centres around the 'true story' of a young Malayan woman, Ah Moi (played by Miss Mary Chai) who makes contact with a British Red Cross Nurse, Miss Jean Wright (played by herself), when her brother is very ill. Jean Wright is our narrator. The film has a highly melodramatic (and rather intrusive) music sound track. The young boy has a high fever and is being nursed by his mother. A glimpse of traditional life is shown. Later, in the health clinic, we see public health posters of the day on the walls, re-inforcing messages about TB etc. The young woman is seen assisting the nurse in her clinic. A new training scheme is described and Ah Moi is then trained to be a full-time nurse. Some of the work of the traveling Red Cross clinics are shown as it journeys around the rural regions of Malaya. Ah Moi travels back to her village, fully trained, to a rapturous welcome."
"This amateur film, which has been edited semi-professionally with additional intertitles and maps to orientate the viewer, consists of footage shot on the BMA's World Tour. This reel has mostly unique material and begins with views of Singapore harbour. A traffic policeman is seen in operation - the traffic is very light.

Next, onto Kuala Lumpur to visit a leper colony, the tin mines and to see rubber tapping. There is extraordinary footage of a man's heart beating in his open chest cavity. Dr Watson Smith stands by a rubber tree. There are brief exterior shots of the Selangor Club, the BMA headquarters. The next stop is Penang before the homeward journey via S.S. Rajputana to London. At the dockside, boats are loaded. Arriving at Colombo, the group is welcomed by the Ceylon branch of the BMA. Then onwards to Bombay - another sequence of a snake charmer. Venom is extracted (duplicate material). There is a reception by the Bombay branch of the BMA together with mute footage of the meeting."

"By the 1960s, with the defeat of smallpox, polio and tuberculosis, people were confident that the days of deadly infectious diseases were over. But confidence was shaken even before the end of that decade with the death of seven workers at a polio vaccine laboratory from Marburg's virus. In 1969 the deadly lassa fever, whose viral source is the rat, was brought to Britain from Sierra Leone. From 1976 onwards, outbreaks of disease caused by the highly infectious ebola virus killed hundreds in Africa. Increasing global travel meant that no disease could be confined to its country of origin. The Heathrow Health Control Unit screens immigrants for tuberculosis. Russia and Eastern Europe are badly affected by TB and the multi drug resistant strain can flare up anywhere in the world. Conference visitors to the US came home with Legionaires disease. Travel within cities on over crowded transport may spread disease. Animals are a chief source of infection: an influenza like illness originating in chickens was passed to humans in Hong Kong in 1997 and a disease originating in pigs killed those working with the animals in 1999 in Malaysia, both outbreaks necessitating the slaughter of the countries chickens and pigs. In Britain, children caught e-coli related illnesses from farm visits. AIDS, identified in 1980, has killed 16 million people. War, trade and travel exported it from Africa and the Western lifestyle encouraged it to flourish. The HIV virus mutates to evade control by drugs and there is still no prospect of a vaccine.

"The following is an interim description which may change when detailed cataloguing takes place in future: Please note that this archive is largely made up of patient data that is highly sensitive in nature. When the archive is catalogued, the patient data will require closure for the lifetime of the data subjects in accordance with the 1998 Data Protection Act. Patient data, summaries and statistical analysis relating to child health survey which took place in Imese, Oke Messi and Ilesha, Nigeria, 1957-1967. Also includes material on a related study of Pyrimethamine, World Health Organisation and UNICEF reports and photographs, 1969-1977, and material relating to the charity War on Want."
"The archive comprises material from Burroughs Wellcome & Company (BW&Co) and, from 1924, the Wellcome Foundation Ltd (WF). Notable elements of the archive are: * Some records of the pre-partnership S M Burroughs Company. * Papers for the two founders Henry S Wellcome and Silas M Burroughs. * Papers of senior managers from BW&Co/WF. * Legal Papers, particularly concerned with Trade Marks and Stamp Duty. * Marketing records - including operational papers, a large collection of images and of publications. * Some financial records, mainly regarding salaries. * Papers relating to WF sites, such as the Wellcome Chemical Works, Dartford. * The records of Coopers, the subsidiary veterinary company, together with records of Coopers own world-wide subsidiary companies. (See separate entry WF/C) * Records of related bodies, the British Insulin Manufacturers Association and The Therapeutic Research Corporation Please note that Board Minutes & Papers, and the Research & Development papers have been retained by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) (formerly GlaxoWellcome (GW)). SITES AND SOURCES FOR LOCAL HISTORY There were several sites used by the Wellcome Foundation and by Coopers, McDougall Robertson. The following gives a good indication of sites for which material can be found but is not exhaustive: BRITAIN * Beckenham - site of the Wellcome Physiological Research Laboratories from 1921, 'Langley Court'. * Berkhamsted - this was the main office and works site for Coopers, McDougall Robertson the veterinary medical supplies company. The Cooper family were prominent in local society and economy and there are many specifically personal and local history items held in the archive. * 'Brockwell Hall', Herne Hill - site of the Wellcome Physiological Research Laboratories from 1897 -c.1921. * Dartford Chemical Works from 1888- previously 'Phoenix Paper Mills', the site included 'Kepler Wharf'. Nearby was the 'Wellcome Club & Institute'. * Euston - The Wellcome Building 183 Euston Road, originally 'The Wellcome Research Institution' later called the 'Wellcome Building', from 1932. Also Unicorn House - the Head Office of the Wellcome Foundation from 1990. * Frant - the Veterinary Research Station, it consisted of Ely Grange & manor House, with several farms. The most well-known farm was 'Tyburn Farm' where 'Code Name Operation Tyburn' (research into Scrub Typhus) took place during WW2. * Snow Hill - the Head Office site near Holborn Viaduct. Various offices were used from 1879 when Burroughs arrived in London, however the company settled in one set of offices until they were bombed in WW2. * Wandsworth - 'Bell Lane Wharf' the site of the first factory from 1883. OVERSEAS Both Wellcome and Coopers were international companies from very early in their histories with offices and sales agents across the globe. The circa dates given are from the establishment of subsidiary companies, though both companies had dealings in the countries from before these dates. So although Ireland and Spain only gained subsidiary companies late in Wellcome's history, these countries had been targeted from the 1880s. Some of the cities where the main offices were based are also indicated: * Africa - Egypt, Ghana, Kabete, Kenya (1955), Nairobi, Nigeria, South Africa (1902 - East London, Johannesburg), Tanzania (1974), Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe * America - Argentina (1910), Brazil (1955), Canada (c1906), Caribbean, Cuba, Mexico (1967), USA (1906 - New York; Greenville; Tuckahoe; Research Triangle Park), * Asia - Arabian Gulf (1977), Ceylon (1976), China , Hong Kong (1972), India (1912), Indonesia, Iran (1973), Japan (1971), Jordan, Korea, Kuwait, Malaysia (1968), Nepal, Pakistan (1956), Philippines (1968), Saudi Arabia, Shanghai (1908), Singapore (1968), Syria, Taiwan, Thailand (1972), * Australasia - Australia (1886 - Sydney), New Zealand (1954) * Europe - Austria (1972), Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Finland, Germany (1967), Greece, Holland (1967), Hungary, Ireland (1972 - Dublin), Italy (Milan 1905), Malta, Monaco (1964), Norway, Portugal (1973), Russia, Spain (1966), Sweden, Switzerland (1978), Turkey * In addition Wellcome's work on the Wellcome Research Laboratories (later the Wellcome Tropical Research Laboratories) at Gordon College, Khartoum in the Sudan are also well documented - particularly in Wellcome's correspondence (see WF/E/01). COOPERS Coopers had a strong connection with countries that had large sheep or cattle herds (hence little connection with Asia). Those with no dates in brackets were formed as companies pre 1960: * Africa - Kenya, Rhodesia, South Africa, Uganda (1971), Zambia (1969) * America - Argentina, Paraguay (1969), Peru (1965), Uruguay, USA, Venezuela (1965) * Australasia - Australia, New Zealand * Europe - Belgium, France, Italy, Ireland, Spain"
"A copy of Constantinus Africanus, Viaticum, with glossa by Geraldus Bituricensis, on parchment, written in Gothic hand in France in the late 13th century, with decorated puzzle initials. Contents 1. f. 1: Medical recipe, early 15th-century hand, faint. 2. ff. 2r-93r, Constantinus Africanus, Viaticum, in Latin, with Glosule by Geraldus Bituricensis. The medical summa traditionally called Viaticum or Breviarium, as in the present manuscript, is a Latin adaptation by Constantine the African (c. 1020-1098/9) of a standard medical manual in Arabic, entitled Kitab Zad al-musafir wa-qut al-hadir (i.e. Provision for the Traveller and the Nourishment of the Settled) composed by the Abu Ja'far Ahmad ibn Ibrahim ibn abi Khalid al-Jazzar (Ibn al-Jazzar) (d. 979 or 1004-5), the famous physician of Qeirwan (al-Qayrawan, Kairouan) in Tunisia, who had been a pupil of Ishaq ibn Sulayman al-Isra'ili (fl. c. 855-955), known in Europe as Isaac Judaeus. Most of Ibn al-Jazzar's work was lost, but the Kitab Zad al-musafir survived having been translated into Greek during his lifetime. Constantine's adaptation followed the 'a capite ad calcem' order of the original work and was written in the 1070s or 1080s at Montecassino, from where it was widely disseminated throughout Europe mainly by means of manuscripts copied in Benedictine scriptoria. Constantine's version was conceived as a concise textbook intended for Latin readers, and primarily for the medical school of Salerno. Therefore it remained close to the Arabic original in terms of structure and contents, but differed in length and identification of sources, favouring ancient Greek and Hellenistic references rather than Arabic sources. The Viaticum was taught at medical faculties during the 12th and 13th centuries and was particularly popular in France, as documented by a number of commentaries written within French medical circles up to the 14th century: see Mary Frances Wack, Lovesickness in the Middle Ages. The 'Viaticum' and Its Commentaries (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1990), pp. 31-35; Mirja Martha Brachtel, Ibn al-Jazzar's Zad al-Musafir and Constantinus Africanus' Latin Version Viaticum Peregrinantis: A Comparative Study (Master's thesis, International Islamic University, Malaysia, 2005) [available online at https://www.academia.edu/7595021/IBN_AL-JAZZ%C4%80RS_Z%C4%80D_AL-MUS%C4%80FIR_AND_CONSTANTINUS_AFRICANUS_LATIN_VERSION_VIATICUM_PEREGRINANTIS]. The present manuscript is a copy of the vulgate tradition of the Viaticum (the cataloguer is grateful to Dr Brian Long for the information). The Glosule represent the first surviving full commentary on the Viaticum by Gerardus (Geraldus, Girard) Bituricensis (of Berry), a French physician operating in Paris between the late 12th and early 13th century; he compiled his glossa probably drawing from direct teaching experience and at the request of his Parisian colleagues: see Ernst Wickersheimer, Dictionnaire biographique des médecins en France au moyen âge (Geneva: Droz, 1936), vol. 1, p. 203; Danielle Jacquart, Supplément (Geneva: Droz, 1979), pp. 92-3; Wack, Lovesickness in the Middle Ages, pp. 51-56. The texts are listed in eTK, A digital resource based on Lynn Thorndike and Pearl Kibre, A Catalogue of Incipits of Medieval Scientific Writings in Latin (Cambridge, MA: Mediaeval Academy, 1963; with supplements in 1965 and 1968; online at https://medievalacademy.site-ym.com/?page=Books#etk), nos 817D (main text), 1298H (prologue), and 325J (Gerardus's commentary). For other manuscript copies of Constantine's Latin text in the Wellcome Library, see MSS 208 (imperfect), 209, 547 (ff. 55r-103v; imperfect), 730 (f. 23r; extracts); for copies of Gerardus's commentary see MSS 305, 535 (ff. 61r-120v). Both Constantine's text and Gerardus's commentary were printed for the first time in 1505 in Venice, together with other works by Gerardus: In hoc volumine continentur, Introductorium iuuenum Gerardi de Solo.

"Correspondence with colleagues and friends, organisations and institutions, and on assorted administrative matters, 1922-1982. Gruneberg was in contact with most of the distinguished names in genetics and allied fields of his day, and had significant international contacts, especially in North America and Asia. The letters were kept in one continuous alphabetical sequence. The original filing was fairly methodical - a number of misplaced items were refiled but any idiosyncratic practices which were Gruneberg's own (filing individual under institution, or vice versa) have been retained, and should be rendered unproblematic within a searchable catalogue. In one or two cases a tranche of material on a particular issue was removed to its own file: e.g. Jewish organisations, Gruneberg's involvement with Malaysian academic institutions as external examiner in genetics."

"Documentary looking at feral children and the question of how to rehabilitate them. Oxana Malaya was left outside by her alcoholic parents as a toddler, so crawled into a kennel for warmth and spent more time with dogs than humans, so grew up behaving more like a dog than a child. Dramatic reconstruction illustrates the story of Victor, the first scientifically recorded case of a wild child, discovered in France in 1800. The experiments of Winthrop Kellogg and Harry Harlow, both involving the early development of monkeys, are briefly covered. The case of Jeannie Wiley is explained in detail: she was discovered as a 13-year-old in a house where she had been kept in total isolation by her parents, strapped to a potty chair by day and kept in a cage at night. She was unable to walk and was never spoken to, so was unable to speak. Child Psychologist James Kent and Professor of Linguistics Susan Curtiss talk of their work with Jeannie. In the Ukraine town of Mirny, a 4-year-old boy called Edik who grew up with stray dogs is now living with a foster family. James Law, Professor of Language and Communication, visits Edik to evaluate his prospects. Although, with help, rehabilitated feral children are gradually able to empathise and learn single words, they will not be able to learn spoken language and grammar past the age of 4 years. They will probably have social and emotional problems and difficulties in forming personal relationships. The programme ends by pointing out that we should be inspired by these children because in spite of the horrendous treatment they have had, they have a kernal of humanity that will not be crushed, and are still willing to put out a hand and touch a new person."

"The collection consists of an incomplete set of accounts of Dr Milne-Redhead’s single-handed practice at Mainsriddle, by Dumfries. The two earlier books are informal records of income and expenditure with simple lists of incoming and outgoing payments (including household, family and private expenses) plus year-end analyses. These possibly represent a larger series of rough account books, from which the numbered series of ‘Cash books’ were prepared, which seems likely given that there is an overlap between GP/55/2 and GP/55/3, which both cover the year 1963. The numbered series of ‘Cash Books’ (beginning at no. 6) have Income and Expenditure laid out on facing pages and figures entered in orderly columns under different headings such as ‘Patients’ fees’ ‘Drugs, etc’."

"The last in a series of four programmes looking at some of the more unexpected workings of the mind. This part features feral children - are they the natural experiment that allows us to confront the nature / nurture debate? The programme is focused around the story of 13-year-old Oxana Malaya who, at 3-years-old, was left to sleep with the family pet dogs as her parents were alcoholics. By the time she was 8 she was behaving more like a dog than a human - we see how she has progressed since then. Other stories include the harrowing tale of Jeannie Wiley in the 1970s who for 13 years was kept in silence in a dark room, strapped into a potty chair by day and left to sleep in a chicken wire cage by night. We also see archive footage of Kellogg's experiments with a monkey companion for his baby son and Harry Harlow's experiments on monkeys. The programme ends as Oxana is reunited with her father and one of her sisters."

"Although the Society included members in almost all parts of the world, particularly the British colonies, their numbers and the wide distances between them often precluded the successful formation of overseas Branches and their long-term existence. This series contains records of the East African Branch and the New South Wales Branch only. Some information on the overseas branches, for which there are few records, may be found in the Council minutes, Section B, and Public Health, J.3. The Hong Kong Branch was set up in 1963. Contact lapsed in 1973 but was re-established in 1977. The 'Branch' became independent in 1978 while maintaining affiliation and their title became either The Hong Kong Society of Community Medicine or The Society of Medical Officers of Health, Hong Kong. (See B.1/19, meeting papers for Jul 1977 and Feb 1978). No records in this deposit. M Pelling's 'Handlist of Public Health Records', 1985, states that some records are in the possession of Dr S McClatchey. Efforts to locate them in 1998-1999 were unsuccessful. A Malayan Branch existed at least from 1925-1934. Public Health Vol 37 No 5, Feb 1924, p117, states that the Society of Medical Officers of Health for Malaya asked for some form of affiliation to the Society. This proposal was discussed in 1925. The Malayan Branch appears in the journal's Branch elections list for the sessions 1925/26 through to 1933/34. It is not known what happened to the Branch after this date. A Malayan Branch re-appears in the election lists for 1956/57. The editorial of Public Health Nov 1956, Vol 70 No 1, p21, states that a new Branch in Malaya was 'coming into being' and Vol 71 No 3, Jun 1957, p117, contains a report of the 'birth' of the Malayan Branch, Nov 1956. It is not known when this Branch ceased to exist. No records in this deposit. Southern Australia Branch: Public Health Nov 1900, Vol 13 No 2, p134 contains an extract from the Australian Medical Gazette reporting the recent formation of a Society of Medical Officers of Health in Adelaide, which would be known as the South Australian Branch of the Incorporated Society of Medical Officers of Health in England. This was the first overseas/colonial Branch of the Society. The first meeting was held in Sep 1900 at which the president, T Borthwick, gave an address on 'The outbreak of plague (so-called) in South Australia, from a personal standpoint'. The Branch was dissolved by the Council of the Society, at the request of members, in 1903. No records in this deposit. The South Indian Branch existed at least from 1925-1934. Public Health Dec 1923, Vol 37 No 3, p68, states that the Society had received an inquiry from Medical Officers of Health in the Province of Madras, India, regarding formation of a local Branch of the Society. The Executive Secretary was directed to consult members of the Society in India in reference to this proposal. The South Indian Branch appears in the journal's Branch elections lists 1925/26-1933/34. It is not known what happened to the Branch after this date. No records in this deposit."

"Sir Leonard Rogers made many significant contributions in the field of tropical medicine: among the diseases for which he made revolutionary advances in treatment were cholera, amoebic dysentery and abscess of the liver, and leprosy. He also did important work on Kala-azar, the differentiation of tropical fevers, snake-venoms, the treatment of tuberculosis, and the animal diseases of rinderpest and surra. He was instrumental in bringing about the foundation of the Calcutta School of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, and was a founder member of the British Empire Leprosy Relief Association. He also played a significant part as a propagandist for the Research Defence Society. He made important studies in epidemiology, in particular the relationship between climate and disease, with specific reference to India. He received numerous honours and distinctions. His publications were very many and diverse (see E/1). Considerable arrangement of the papers had already taken place and it was clear that after Rogers's retirement from service in India he had given much attention to the preservation of the record of his work, by the preparation of summary notes of the contents of his diaries and by the editing of his diaries to make them more legible and bring out the events of significance and by the arrangement of correspondence. Most of the correspondence and notes deposited by Rogers with the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine had been arranged into bundles by subject, with introductory notes and lists of contents (and in some cases attached indexes). Most letters also include a brief note added by Rogers giving the correspondent's name and the main subject. This arrangement has been retained but an index to correspondents has been prepared . Besides the subject groups of papers there is a small group of letters to and from individuals which seem to have been principally of personal interest to Rogers. Although Rogers's own arrangement of the papers has been retained as far as possible, since they were deposited originally over a period of time it has not been possible to be completely consistent in the allocation of materials to particular sections of the list; for example some of the items in A.55 complement material to be found in Section C."

"The collection includes: records of the Society's central organisation including council and committee minutes, annual reports and accounts, 1856-1997; lists of members, 1895-1958 and 1990-1997; files relating to early activities, 1866-1908; Society publications including the journal Public Health, 1891-1994; files of comments and evidence provided by the Society, 1950-1997; minutes and files of regional Branches and specialist Groups of the Society, 1875-1997; and records of the Society's Faculty of Community Health, 1988-1998. Also included are some non-Society records such as public health literature, 1902-1991, and files relating to the journal The Medical Officer, 1897-1973. Section L comprises over 200 files, covering the 1950s to 1990s, relating to comments and evidence produced by the Society, which illustrate the extent of its activities and importance as an advisory body and source of specialist knowledge. Accordingly, it also provides a wealth of information on various public health topics, which supplements that contained in the Society's journal Public Health. The collection includes Vols 3-89 of the journal, covering 1890-1975, and incomplete volumes up to 1994. As well as being a medium for the publication of scientific articles and discussion of contemporary issues, Public Health stands as an important record of the Society's proceedings, role and policies. As a research tool it is equal in importance to much of the primary material in the collection and often fills in gaps in the latter. Records representing some of the Society's early activities in the emerging public health field are listed in Section K. Records of the Society's Branches, Regions and Groups form a major part of the collection. Branches and Groups were entitled to conduct their business independently of the central body and therefore records were not kept at Society headquarters. Many had to be located and retrieved by the Secretary and the Oxford Unit from former secretaries or members, local health authorities and libraries in the 1970s. A number of records, particularly of Branches, have been permanently placed in local repositories. Although the majority of Branch and Group records are listed or accounted for in Sections N and P and Appendices 1-2, some gaps still remain. Efforts made in 1998-1999 to trace additional material were largely unsuccessful, and it is likely that some papers are held in unknown repositories and privately, or have simply been destroyed. What has survived varies greatly in content, quantity and quality. This can be attributed to the level of activity, efficiency of the Secretary and custodial history. Records mainly comprise minute books and files maintained by the local or group secretary and the Society Secretary. Some minute books include transcripts of papers read, correspondence, menu cards, photographs and other ephemera, giving a broader picture of activities, e.g. Northern and Yorkshire Branches (N.8 & 15) and the School Health Service and Services (Hygiene) Groups (P.9 & 10). Records of the Society's Faculty of Community Health, including minutes and publications, are listed under Section Q, but they suffer from a number of gaps. Section R comprises a rich collection of secondary sources which vividly document and illustrate public health measures, policies and issues chiefly in the first half of the 20th century."

"King Pinklao was the full younger brother of King Mongkut. He was crowned as the Second King on the coronation day. He died on 7 January 1865, but the construction of the present meru north of the Grand Palace in Bangkok had taken a full year. In Thai cosmology the meru is a representation of Mount Meru, the centre of the universe, from which the king had descended to rule, and to which he would now return. The king's urn was housed inside. The photograph shows the main meru on the left with an open space in front of it demarcated by poles for parasols and fireworks. Thomson's negative number 404 shows the same structure. The shadowy tracks of figures in movement are visible. Perhaps slightly later in the preparations for the cremation.

Born at Maklong near Bankok in Siam in about May 1811, of Chinese extraction; they were taken to America and then England in 1829, where they were exhibited causing great excitement. They were placed under the medical charge of G.B. Bolton, M.R.C.S., who made extensive observations along with others at the time. After visiting the principal cities in Europe they returned to America to settle as farmers in North Carolina, adopting the name of Bunker and marrying two sisters who bore each of them many healthy children. In 1869 they made another tour through Europe and took advice from eminent surgeons of Britain and France on the feasibility of being separated, with no ultimate conclusion.

"Malaria in the Gambia, Cambodia and Vietnam is becoming a drug-resistant disease, with cerebral malaria needing the most urgent action. In Asia the Thailand/Cambodia border is the epicentre of the disease. Thousands of Thai prospectors seeking precious stones in the border area return home with the malaria parasite in their blood. Self-medication then gives rise to drug resistant malaria. Dr. Nicholas White (University of Oxford) forecast disaster for these countries unless incentives are provided for research into new treatments. The best hope, meanwhile, seems to lie in an ancient chinese plant remedy for cerebral malaria. The film also looks at Thailand's battle against AIDS, begun too late to stem the epidemic. Funding for malaria treatment has fallen off in favour of research into an AIDS vaccine - although malaria is by far the greater killer."

Chinese labourers were much in demand in southeast Asia because of their willingness to undertake the hardest work. For these economic migrants, the main attraction of working abroad was the pay. At two or three dollars a month, their earnings were much higher than what they could receive back home. After having saved enough money, many would return home and buy a plot of land"

"This documentary introduces us to the tallest known children in the world today; some are naturally tall and others have medical conditions that have determined their size. 13-year-old Brendan Adams is over 7 foot tall and is thought to be the tallest child in the world. He has a very rare genetic condition which also makes his joints swollen - walking is very painful. The van Ness family are the tallest family in Britain; every member is well above average including the mum and dad. Craig Glenday, editor of the Guinness Book of World Records travels to Thailand to meet 17-year-old Marley who is possibly the tallest woman in the world. She has a tumour on her pituitary gland and unless it is treated she will continue to get taller - as her family is so poor they can't afford the medicine unless she earns money from her status as the tallest girl in the world. Angelique Cooper is, at 8-years-old, the height of an average 10-year-old. She's inherited her height from her father who is 6,10."" He is concerned that she will inherit his large height and takes her to see Professor Noel Cameron in order to predict her future height. A Jamaican girl, Marvadine, is 15-years-old and is 6,9"" tall; her sister is just 4 inches shorter."
"In the 1930s Japan developed a biological warfare programme to strengthen its hold on China which it invaded in 1937. The water supplies of small Chinese towns were infected with laboratory-grown bacteria as an experiment and samples were taken from victims who were then murdered. Chinese men were also rounded up for use in germ warfare experiments, which included anthrax spores, bubonic plague and glanders. The Japanese also set up germ warfare centres in Manchuria, Thailand and Singapore. Throughout the 1940s they field-tested bombs containing anthrax spores and even collected plague-infected fleas which were packed into bombs and dropped over China. Britain experimented with anthrax in 1942 on the island of Gruinard. There is film of these experiments, in which sheep were used to test the spread and toxicity of the anthrax organism. However, germ 'bombs' were never put into mass production in Britain. Japanese efforts to produce a war-winning weapon were finally defeated by the US atom bomb; and after World War II germ warfare research became a serious business in the US. That country gave an undertaking that it would be for defence purposes only, but elsewhere in the world biological weapons research was directed towards aggressive as well as defensive ends, with Iraq causing current concern over its holdings and their potential use."

"A study of transsexuality which includes detailed stories from transsexuals and accounts from professionals in the area of human sexuality. The programme begins with the tragic story of Gwen Araujo who was murdered by a group of young men, two of which were former lovers, when they discovered she was a male. Transsexuals Calpernia Addams and Andrea James who run a website for transsexual people discuss their sexuality. Max Beck, born a hermaphrodite (intersex), tells how he was raised a girl but later on while settled in a lesbian relationship decided to begin to live as a male. Professor Maria Patino was disqualified as an Olympic athlete when blood tests revealed her to be a 'man' despite her living her life since birth as female. We see Noah, a 10-year-old transsexual child and his family trying to come to terms with his sexuality. Louis Gooren in Amsterdam talks about latest research into brain scans of transsexuals. We also hear about transsexuality in different cultures - a young Indian man becomes a woman, and in Thailand so-called 'lady boys' talk about how their transsexuality has affected their lives. The programme ends by looking again at the aggression transsexuals are frequently confronted with. Lester Wright narrates the findings of his 1996 study to assess how much of homophobia might be an aggression stemming from the denial / self-deception of the homophobe towards their own ambiguous sexuality."

"This collection of Product Literature was maintained by the Marketing Department of the Wellcome Foundation Ltd. It appears to have been instigated after the demise of the 'Guard Book' - volumes containing examples of product literature c.1880-c.1950 (see WF/M/GB). However, there are some items in this 'later' series surviving from before 1950. It forms an extraordinarily complete set of pharmaceutical product literature for the late 20th century (c.1950-1990). The collection includes some high-profile products for key drugs, such as Daraprim (anti-malarial) or Zovirax (anti-viral), and popular over the counter remedies such as Actifed or Calpol. The majority of the series is from the original collection, and remains in its original order (A-Z by Product name). Some additional loose items of product literature were incorporated as part of the sorting process upon arrival at the Wellcome Library in 2002. For each product listed there are varying numbers of surviving literature. The 'Extent' shows the number of producible items (i.e. how many folders). Where less than 6 pieces of product literature survive these are given as sub-items. E.g. 1 Item (2 sub-items). If no subitems are indicated the researcher can assume there is a substantial amount of material surviving. The type of literature varies as to whether the product was a prescription or 'over the counter' product. Marketing and press packs survive for some products. Prescription drugs have technical information leaflets which were for use by the medical profession (usually accompanying the pills in their packaging). Some packaging also survives - these tend to be simple boxes with a standard corporate design and text. Over the counter products contain advertising material aimed at consumers. These are often visual, with images associated with a particular brand, logos, pamphlets, posters, 'educational' advertising aimed at individuals or parents. Packaging also survives and this tends to be more vibrant than the prescription drugs - with clearly specific brand designs. Products were marketed throughout the world, including: Europe - Croatia, England, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Norway, Portugal, Russia, Spain, Sweden, Yugoslavia; Asia - Burma, China, India, Indonesia, Lebanon, Pakistan, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand; Africa - Kenya, Nigeria; North America - Canada, USA, and South America - Argentina. Languages included: mainly in English, but also in Arabic, Chinese, Danish, Dutch/Flemish, Finnish, German, Italian, Japanese, Norwegian, Portuguese, Russian, Serbo-Croat, Spanish and Swedish. Sometimes included are small complimentary marketing items given to medical staff - such as post it notes, pens, note pads, magnets, window stickers, coasters, window/point of sale display boards, magic writing tablets and other small 'executive toys'. Although recorded in lists created prior to transfer to the Wellcome Library, the following material was not identified at the time of cataloguing and therefore is not present in the catalogue: WF/M/PL/152 - Hypoloid - General WF/M/PL/207 - Neokharsivan:Phenothiazine Compound Dispersible WF/M/PL/206 - Neokharsivan:Kharsulphan WF/M/PL/299 - Stypen (Russell Viper Venom)"
"Horizon tells the story of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic from the point of view of the World Health Organization (WHO) which had the task of containing this dangerous viral illness. The WHO was first alerted by Dr. Carlo Obani of Hanoi who was alarmed at the symptoms of one of his hospital patients. Dr. Obani was unaware that the virus was already spreading through the hospital and in a short time, 60 patients died from it. Dr. Obani also became fatally infected. There had been rumours of a fatal disease spreading through Guandong, China, but China issued no warning and took no action. By the time the urgency of the situation was recognised, the virus had already spread across the border to Hong Kong and from Hong Kong its route was open to the rest of the world. At WHO Headquarters, Geneva, the Global Awareness and Response Unit took the unusual step of implementing its war plan. As well as Hong King and Vietnam, Singapore and Canada were already experiencing cases of SARS. This was the name give to it by the WHO. They announced a worldwide alert and sent out guidelines to hospitals. Even as they were setting up these precautions, new cases were identified in Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand and Germany. It was an urgent matter to identify the virus so the world's top microbiologists were asked to co-operate with each other in the search. The index case - the first person to contract the illness - was identified, Dr. Jianlun Liu, a Chinese doctor, who had carried the virus to Hong Kong. Method of tranmission was established and a breakthrough occurred with the isolation of the virus from a patient. It proved to be a corona virus which normally causes nothing worse than the common cold in humans, but this one had changed; probably an animal virus, it was likely that it had jumped species in Guandong, China, where people live at close quarters with their livestock. The human immune system is unprepared for the onslaught of new virus and the results can be lethal. There is no antidote for SARS; patients can be supported but ultimately the strenght of their immune systems resovles the battle one way or another. Four weeks after the start of the outbreak the WHO had identified the virus and its likely origin. But the disease was still spreading and there was doubt as to whether the WHO was in control of the outbreak. As panic mounted, however, the WHO's tactics began to take effect. Countries co-ordinated their resistance; Singapore screened everyone entering and leaving the country; hospitals screened patients, doctors and visitors and in Toronto 10,000 people were asked to go into voluntary quarantine. A medical team in Canada cracked the virus's genetic code and the virus was found to be barely mutating (unlike the HIV virus). If it remains stable there is a chance of developing a vaccine - but not in the near future. China's outbreak proved to be far greater than the country had admitted, but even so, the worst is now know about SARS and its death rate is lower than in severe outbreaks of influenza. The task is now to contain it within China, with the aim of eradicating it. This programme was filmed in Hanoi, Guandong, Hong Kong, Geneva, Ontario and Toronto. Contributors include Dr. Mike Ryan (Global Awareness and Response Unit, WHO), Dr. Klaus Stohr (influenza specialist, WHO), Dr. Sheila Basrur (Medical Office of Health, Toronto), Dr. Mike Leahy (virologist)."
"The following is an interim description which may change when detailed cataloguing takes place in future: Please note that the majority of this archive consists of patient data that is highly sensitive in nature. When the archive is catalogued, the patient data will require closure for the lifetime of the data subjects in accordance with the 1998 Data Protection Act. For fuller information on how the library handles sensitive archival data, see our Access to Archives policy Papers relating to Sunitha Wickramasinghe's haematology research and patients, 1970s to early 2000s. Includes numerous black and white prints of electronmicrographs (EMGs) of patient blood and bone marrow with related index books, including HIV patients; some correspondence about specific patients and cases; EMGs of fish and amphibians; a set of his published papers; material relating to alcohol toxicity research; some material relating to international conferences he attended; and some material relating to haematology lectures. Note that material relating specifically to Congenital Dyserythropoietic Anaemias (CDA) was transferred directly to Oxford University which already acquired other CDA material prior to the transfer of material to the Wellcome Library."

A card index to the 'Foundation News' and 'Wellcome Journal', was created c.1980-89, covering the years 1951-1989. It has been reproduced below (the original is catalogued as WF/M/PB/01/01/43). However, the Index is of selected subjects only. If a possible news item does not appear in the index but the date is known (such as a retirement) a manual check of the publication would be worthwhile. Arranged alphabetically by subject, giving date of edition and page number for each reference (for the most part). The subjects include products, people working for or associated with the firm, locations in which the firm operated, and general subjects which the company was working on (for example 'immunology'). Once you have found the date of the publication you need, order it using the list which follows. NOTES ON USING THE INDEX Indexed term is given in capital letters, in alphabetical order. Products are filed under trade name not generic names Wellcome Trustees are all under Wellcome Trust Reagents are under diagnostics People (if no individual card may be entered under local companies) Local companies are under country not company name i.e. Cooper Zeltia and Gayoso Wellcome - Spain WIHM under Wellcome Institute [Dates - Jun 66 means June 1966. All dates refer to 20th century] [The abbreviation FN is sometimes used to denote 'Foundation News'] ACTIFED Jun 66(17) taken on space flights. Jun 81(3) Actifed carried on US space shuttle.

"The papers are the product of a period of considerable spiritual, cultural and political change in China. They are a significant source for study of the development of Protestant missions in China (in particular the role of the medical mission and the introduction of Western medicine), and also provide evidence of the involvement of the missionaries with issues of British trade and diplomacy. MSS. 5827-5852: correspondence and papers, especially of the Revd Robert Morrison (1782-1834), missionary in China, 1807-1834; John Robert Morrison (1814-1843), Chinese interpreter, Colonial Secretary of the Hong Kong government; and Dr Benjamin Hobson (1816-1873), medical missionary in China, 1839-1859. The majority comprise personal and domestic correspondence of the Morrison and Hobson families and their friends, with less emphasis on official papers, although the collection includes letters on the Peacock expedition to Siam and Cochin China led by Edmund Roberts (1784-1836), United States merchant and diplomat, 1832 (MS.5830), and letters to Benjamin Hobson from leading missionaries. 1843-62 (MS.5839). Insight into missionary work in China can be gained in particular from the letters of the Revd. Robert Morrison. MS. 7127: 'Domestic Memoir of Mrs Morrison', by the Revd. Robert Morrison, addressed to his children Mary Rebecca and John Robert Morrison (1814-1843), 5-7 January 1824. Mary Morrison, Robert's first wife, died of cholera at Macao on 10 June 1821. This memoir was compiled by Robert Morrison during the voyage home from China aboard H.E.I.C.S. 'Waterloo'."

"A training film made for Indonesian field workers (with opening credits and dialogue in Malay) which has been repurposed to show their work to other parts of the world. A young woman (Jati) who is a family planning field worker visits the chief administrator of a village to make sure that she is welcome there. With the information she is given, she identifies a family to visit to discuss contraceptive advice. She meets the mother of three young children and agrees to a meeting. The field worker recommends that children are paced two or more years apart as the mother has been unwell and the youngest baby is failing to thrive. The mother has a visit from her mother-in-law and another woman who are a bit sceptical; Jati agrees to return later and speak to the mother with her husband. A young couple with less money discuss the issues around having a large family. The field worker shows the couple the different methods of contraception and ascertains the level of interest for each type. She leaves some literature and a paper fan as a souvenir of the visit. She next visits a woman fitted with an IUD; the woman reports a few side-effects and Jati notes them down. Jati returns to the first house and tells the husband about pacing pregnancies. The traditional 'dukun' or midwife passes the field worker and they greet each other amicably. The fieldworker writes up her notes. Field workers meet together and debrief each other on their experiences."

In 1801 Flinders had set out in the ship Investigator to circumnavigate Australia and produce a detailed survey of its coastline, especially the southern coast which was still unknown, for the British government. In June 1803 the survey was abandoned due to the poor condition of the ship. Flinders sailed for England on HMS Porpoise to get another vessel to continue the survey but was ship-wrecked on the Great Barrier Reef. He managed to navigate the ship's cutter back to Sydney and arrange the rescue of the marooned crew. He then attempted to return to England but had to stop at Mauritius for repairs in Dec 1803. At this time France and England were at war and Flinders was detained as a spy by the French Governor. Flinders wrote to Sir Joseph Banks who was able to influence the French government that he was a scientist and explorer, not a spy, and approve his release. However, the French governor, General De Caen refused to release him and he remained a prisoner for six and a half years. After his release and return to England in 1810 he began working on his book A Voyage to Terra Australis but lived only one day after its publication in 1814."

(Salmon, op. cit. p. 114) The ape is described as having human characteristics (Salmon, op. cit., p. 115: ""Monkeys also abound here: Mr. Leguat, who resided in Java some years, relates, that he saw a monkey that was kept in one of the bastions at at Batavia, that came very near the human form; that it was a female, went upright on its hinder legs, was very tall, and concealed the pudenda with one of its hands; that she made her bed neatly every day in a little house her master had built for her, and lying down at night, covered herself with a quilt, and sometimes would bind her head with a cloth, and seemed to grieve as if she had the head-ach. Mr. Leguat imagined great pains had been taken to teach the creature to perform such actions, as seemed to be the result of reason, while others were of opinion it was the issue of an ape and a female slave; for when a slave has committed a great fault, or what the Dutch are pleased to call such, they frequently run up into the mountains, and live perfectly wild, and supposes that this creature was begot on her mother by some male ape."")"

"Wollaston and Boden Closs led a British expedition in 1912-1913 to follow the Utakwa (Otakwa) River and climb the Carstenzs Peaks in Papua, Indonesia. Though not successful in reaching the peaks, Wollaston was awarded the Gill Medal of the Royal Geographical Society on his return. During the expedition he made many observations of the Amungme (Uhunduni) people, who came to see the British explorers in the belief that the latter were revenant spirits of the dead who would lead them to paradise. Ballard, 'A.F.R. Wollaston and the ""Utakwa River Mountain Papuan"" skulls', loc. cit., suggests that Wollaston surreptitiously cut off and took away the heads of Amungme people who had died of malaria or starvation as a result of leaving their homeland to go and see them. Several human skulls from the expedition were presented by Wollaston to the British Museum (Natural History)"

"This is a follow-on documentary to 'Half Man Half Tree' which features 36-year-old Dede who lives in Jakarta, Indonesia, and has an extremely unusual condition which has led to his body becoming covered in branch-like structures. Dede's only income is as a performer in an Indian circus troupe, a psychologically cruel and physiologically painful means of supporting his family. Dr Anthony Gaspari, Chairman of the Department of Dermatology, University of Maryland ran tests on Dede and believed his condition was due to an infestation of a rare wart virus which had run out of control because of his extremely weak immune system. He wanted to treat Dede's condition with drugs rather than surgery. However the medical team at Hasan Sadikin Hospital want to operate on Dede and the Indonesian government encourage a huge media circus and admit him to the hospital for an intensive 6-month period of surgery. The surgery is shown in some detail. Eventually Dr. Gaspari is invited to Indonesia to present his plan to help Dede without relying on surgery alone - the wart virus is so virulent it will grow back quickly despite surgery. In the end Dede undergoes a combination of surgery and chemotherapy. He returns home in the hope that one day he will be completely cured."

"In Jakarta, Indonesia, 36-year-old Dede has an extremely unusual condition which has led to his body becoming covered in branch-like structures. Dede has two children but his wife left him due to his condition and his inability to work leaving their children to be being raised by his sister in the village. Dede's only income is as a performer in an Indian circus troupe, a psychologically cruel and physiologically painful means of supporting his family. Dr. A. Gaspari, Chairman of the Department of Dermatology, University of Maryland, visits Dede to attempt to diagnose Dede's condition. He takes biopsies, tests Dede's immune system and runs genetic tests on Dede's whole family. Gaspari favours medical treatment rather than surgical. Not so in the case of Ion from Rumania who has a similar condition to Dede and is operated on by Dr. Laskar in Bucharest to remove multiple warts from his hand, a procedure which has mixed results and may not provide long-term relief. Dr. Gaspari discovers that Dede's condition is caused by his very low immune system and a voracious wart virus. He devises a treatment that should lead to the complete disappearance of the warts but Dede does not take him up on the offer, preferring for the time being to continue working with the circus troupe."

"Presented by Professor Alice Roberts, this programme explores how recent research and genetic techniques have given us insight into the four distinct groups of humans who lived on the planet at the same time as ourselves; examining the complexity of human evolution. Roberts starts with the Neanderthals, travelling to Gibraltar where Prof Clive Finlayson of the Gibraltar Museum has been studying a cave system which contains the final refuge of the Neanderthals. Finlayson explains how the stereotypes regarding Neanderthals have been proven wrong evidence shows they were not only very cultured, but even capable of abstract thought, an ability that was previously thought to be exclusive to Homo sapiens. Professor Chris Stringer of the Natural History Museum, who has spent the last 30 years investigating the similarities and differences between modern humans and Neanderthals, explains that the two groups shared much of the same behaviour. With master flint knapper John Lord, Stringer looks at the tools Neanderthals used, which were the result of an exchange of ideas between the two groups. These interactions between Neanderthals and modern humans also helped our ancestors learn how to deal with the colder temperatures outside Africa. Professor Svante Pääbo, a geneticist from the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, then recounts how the excavation of a small finger bone in a cave in Siberia led to his team discovering the genome of an entirely new human group, which they called the Denisovans. So did modern humans come in contact with the Denisovans? The discovery of modern human teeth in Daoxian in China enabled archaeologist Dr Maria Martinón-Torres of UCL and her colleagues at the Chinese Academy of Sciences to date the move out of Africa at around 100,000 years ago. This means that our ancestors would have been living in Asia and Europe at the same time as Denisovans and Neanderthals. Anthropologists Dr Laura Shackelford and Dr Fabrice Demeter then recount the discovery of the third extinct human group, Homo floresiensis, in the small island of Flores in Indonesia. This species were nicknamed hobbits due to their small size, the result of island dwarfism. But since so many human groups have been discovered, Professor Roberts asks the pressing question why did Homo sapiens survive, when all these other groups died out? Professor Stringer discusses the environmental factors that led to the extinction of Neanderthals, and Dr Janet Kelso of the Max Planck Institute explains how the lack of genetic diversity would have been a major factor as well. However, genetic research has allowed us to realise that present-day human beings actually share some DNA with these extinct groups, which Dr Kelso explains was the result of interbreeding. Her team were able to analyse DNA from people all over the world and concluded that those from within Africa generally lacked Neanderthal DNA, whereas people living outside of Africa often did have it as their ancestors had come in contact with Neanderthal groups. They even found traces of Denisovan DNA, particularly among Papua New Guineans, Aboriginal Australians, and Tibetans. Most recently, a fifth Hominin group was discovered by Professor Joshua Akey, a geneticist at the University of Washington. Very little is known about this group as no fossil evidence exists, and thus far they are known simply as an Archaic African group whose DNA can only be found in some parts of central Africa. Professor Roberts explains that all of these recent discoveries have forced us to completely reimagine our linear view of human evolution, and that genetics has made a huge difference to the study of our species."

"At two years old several vast tumours spread over the face of Indonesian boy Novemthree, blinding him and leaving him with breathing, speaking and eating problems. At five he had the largest facial tumour in medical history. This documentary is a follow-up to one with the same name broadcast at the end of 2004. We see how the previous surgery certainly helped Novemthree but the predictions of his future care have taken a depressing turn and after only a year Novemthree's tumours have grown substantially. He returns to the Tzu Chi Foundation (a unique Buddhist-inspired hospital) for more surgery. Unfortunately tragic complications meant that Novemthree's surgery was postponed and he died before it took place."

"The third in a very informative three-part series in which Andrew Marr looks in depth at all aspects of Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection. This part looks at how the way we inhabit the earth is leading to mass extinction and how we've struggled to understand and accept the full implications of Darwin's legacy. Marr looks back at how Darwin's theory of natural selection upset the Victorian people of his tme and led to his fears at publishing his research. However, in the Indonesian jungle, naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace was reaching similar conclusions to Darwin. He wrote to Darwin and Darwin was finally impelled to publish. Following this, Ernst Heckel founded the science of ecology; Wallace noted the way in which extinction could be induced by the interference of man rather than being a natural part of evolution. Darwin's final book was on worms and showed how vital the earthworm is to our lives. The effects of industrialisation led to huge concerns about our changing relationship with nature; William Morris, in particular, campaigned to save the beauty of the English countryside. But it wasn't until the arrival of moth enthusiast James W Tutt that Darwin's theory was connected to the effect of industrialisation on evolution. His discovery showed that in industrialised areas, the black version of the peppered moth survived and increased, while the paler variety became extinct. This provided proof that the behaviour of humankind on their environment could directly influence the path of evolution. Other ecological studies ensued, leading to Rachel Carson's publication of 'Silent Spring,' which looked into the dangers of pesticides; a book now regarded as the original battle cry for the modern environmental movement. James Lovelock expanded Darwinian theory to describe a global ecosystem based on biological feedback. He called this the Gaia hypothesis. This coupled with the first view of our planet taken from the surfaceof the earth, led to the beginnings of environmentalism."

"""We had heard much of a person said to be covered all over with hair, and who, it was insisted upon, more resembled an ape than a human being ; a description, however, which, I am glad to say, was by no means realized by his appearance. Having expressed a curiosity to see this individual, the King politely sent him over to our dwelling some days ago, and Dr. Wallich and I took down on the spot the following account of himself and his history. His name was Shwe-Maong, and he stated himself to be thirty years of age. He was a native of the district of Maiyong-gyi, a country of Lao, situated on the Saluen, or Martaban river, and three months' journey from Ava. The Saubwa, or chief of the country, presented him to the King as a curiosity when a child of five years of age, and he had remained in Ava ever since. His height was five feet three inches and a half, which is about the ordinary stature of the Burmese. His form was slender, if compared with the usually robust make of the Hindoo-Chinese races, and his constitution as rather delicate. In his complexion there was nothing remarkable, although upon the whole he was perhaps rather fairer than the ordinary run of Burmese. The colour of his eyes was a dark brown, not so intense as that of the ordinary Burman. The same thing may be said of the hair of the head, which was also a little finer in texture, and less copious. The whole forehead, the cheeks, the eyelids, the nose, including a portion of the inside, the chin—in short, the whole face, with the exception of the red portion of the lips, were covered with a fine hair. On the forehead and cheeks this was about eight inches long ; and on the nose and chin, about four inches. In colour, it was of a silvery grey ; its texture was silky, lank, and straight. … Our draftsman made very faithful sketches of the father and youngest child, to which I refer. After making the party presents, they took their leave of us, extremely grateful for our attention. Shwe-maong, we found, had been occasionally employed by the Court as a buffoon, having been taught to imitate the antics of a monkey. For these feats, however, the poor fellow does not seem to have been very liberally rewarded ; for, to subsist himself and family, he was obliged to betake himself to the trade of a basket-maker, in which he was now employed. He would have turned his monstrosity to better account in London.""--Crawfurd, op. cit., pp. 318-323"

"""Execution of a dacoit-Burma This sketch, forwarded by a gentleman serving with the Burma Field Force, depicts an execution of a dacoit at Shway Bo, Upper Burma. These insurgent brigands have effectually prevented the tranquillisation of Upper Burma since the British occupation, and have necessitated a number of small expeditions on the part of our troops in order to restore order in the affected districts. One of these was undertaken by the Royal Welsh Fusiliers to Shway Bo, where the dacoits had committed considerable havoc. One of the chief offenders being taken prisoner was duly tried and shot-- promptness in these matters being essential when dealing with hostile Orientals.""—The graphic, loc. cit."

"Prince Dri-med-kun-Idan, also known in Tibetan as Prince Thams-cad-sgrol (Saviour of all, literally ""Liberating all""), in Sanskrit as Viśvantara, and in Pali as Vessantara, is a former incarnation of the Buddha Gautama. The prince was so compassionate that when asked for a wish-fulfilling gem belonging to his father the king, he took it and gave it away. He was exiled to Koṅ-po (Kongpo) in Tibet, near the Buchu geomantic temple, and by and by gave away his wife, his children and his eyes. After much hardship all these were restored to him. The story, in the form of a drama, is often performed in Tibet and in Southern Buddhist countries such as Burma and Sri Lanka In the centre of the painting is Padma Sambhava (Tibetan Pa-dma-'byuṅ-gnas, ""He who was born out of the Lotus""), generally called Guru Rinpoche (""precious teacher""), founder of the Nyingmapa school of Buddhism in Tibet"

"Excerpted from the Introduction to the Report: ""The out-break of war in the Far East with the movement of large numbers of troops into the battle areas presented the Allied High Command with many problems in the combatting of infectious diseases. In many parts of the Far Eastern war zone scrub typhus was endemic with the result that jungle warfare against the Japanese in Burma and other areas produced a great increase in the incidence of the disease."" [p. 1] ""The request from the Army High Command for a sufficient quantity of vaccine to be prepared to carry out extensive trials in troops engaged in combat areas carrying a risk of scrub typhus meant that 1½ million doses of scrub typhus vaccine would be required. The preparation of this quantity of vaccine was outside the resources of the National Institute for Medical Reseach. As the result of inquiries by the Ministry of Supply among the leading pharmaceutical manufacturing firms in Great Britain, the Wellcome Foundation agreed to undertake the production.... It was decided to recruit a team of scientific workers from civilian and service personnel available in the country and to appoint a civilian scientific director responsible to the Wellcome Foundation for the direction of the scheme. ""The project was given the highest operational priority with the secret code name of 'Tyburn'."" [pp. 2-3] The project involved the construction of an extensive animal housing facility in Sussex. The cotton rat, initially transported from America, was used to develop the vaccine."

"** The original item is too fragile to be produced. The microfiche version, reference AMS/MF/188, will be produced instead. ** Letterbook consisting of copies of internal and external letters sent by the head office of Burroughs Wellcome & Co, Snow Hill, March - June 1903. Topics covered in this letterbook include the day-to-day running of the business, with detailed correspondence with the Burroughs Wellcome productions site in Dartford and also the branches in Sydney and Cape Town. Iinternal correspondence covers such administrative details as terms of employment and recruitment. There is also correspondence with Burroughs Wellcome's Travelling Salesmen, such letters include discussion on such topics as sales techniques, the opening of new markets, the threat from rival companies and BW&Co products over which complaints have arisen. This letterbook also contains material on the case of Burroughs Wellcome & Co v Thompson and Capper (referred in the letterbook to the 'Manchester case'). The case was brought about after BW&Co accused Thompson and Capper of manufacturing and selling their own pills as Tabloids, and so infringing on BW&C's trademarked term. The letters to Henry Wellcome himself - written to him whilst he was on holiday - are detailed and offer a good summary of the range of issues covered in the rest of the volume. A great deal of these letter concern the 'Manchester case'. Also included is correspondence with various publications over their infringement of BW&Co's 'Tabloid' trade mark. 1000 pages used.

"** The original item is too fragile to be produced. Please order the microfiche version quoting the reference AMS/MF/166 ** 504 pages [ 2 letters on 455 cancelled as too faint] A number of letters were acknowledged by HSW's secretary whilst HSW was on an extended visit to the USA and Mexico, closely followed by a visit to Europe. A number of the letters received during this period were from America - presumably people whom HSW met on his travels. Many of the replies to meetings were to proffer apologies for HSW's absence. Sudlow was given Power of Attorney in HSW's absence - see 372. The contact address for HSW during his travels was c/o Messr Fairchild Bros. & Foster, New York. A number of letters re the purchase of furniture are signed by 'C. Irish &Co.' 'Irish' is referred to in other correspondence by HSW [employed as general handyman for the business?].

"Professor Hans Rosling presents this episode of the BBC’s ‘This World’ Series: ‘Don’t Panic: How to End Poverty in 15 years’. Presenting in front of a live studio audience Rosling discusses poverty around the world and global efforts to deal with this problem. The main premise of the show is examining the United Nations 2015 Millennium Goal 1.1 aiming to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030. After questioning the audience on their perceptions of poverty, Rosling explains the difference between ‘relative’ and ‘extreme poverty’ and uses projected graphs, diagrams and statistics to demonstrate his points on the history of poverty and the relative decline since 1800. Footage of a family from Malawi serves as a case study into people living in extreme poverty. A young family from Cambodia serve as another case study into a family who can enjoy some basic luxuries due to a growing economy."
"This programme chronicles four births taking place in relative levels of poverty across four countries; America, England, Sierra Leone and Cambodia. The documentary is part of a BBC series; ‘Why Poverty?’ and is a cross-media event, spanning 70 broadcasters in 180 countries. The main focus of the series is; why do one billion people globally live in poverty? The documentary opens by posing the question ‘Is it worse to be born poor or die poor?’ Following the pregnancies and births of four women, all of whom would be defined as poor within their respective countries, the documentary discusses the ‘birth right lottery’; depending on your country of birth, the opportunities available to you, whether you are going to thrive or struggle, depends on where you were born. The documentary follows Starr, a 37 year old married mother of four living in San Francisco, California. Although her baby Billy-Jean has a life expectancy of 78, the United States has one of the worst child mortality rates in the developed world. Starr is shown attending the San Francisco Prenatal Programme, set up by Martha Ryan 22 years previously. In its first year the programme had taken into its care 72 expectant mothers; this year that number had reached 517. Ryan believes that this is evidence of a growing gap between those who have and those who have not in American society. The program then moves to Sierra Leone where Hawa is expecting her fifth child. According to the documentary, nineteen of the twenty worst countries to be born into are situated in Africa; Sierra Leone is at the bottom of the table. According to statistics, in Sierra Leone the average life span is just 49 and the country suffers from a high child mortality rate. Visiting the Gondama Referral Centre, Dr Philip De Almada and Dr Claire Fotheringham tell of their aim to reduce the maternal mortality rate by 75%; from 1 in 8 to 1 in 25. Dr Fotheringham worked out that it cost as little as €1.7 per mother for their treatment and care. Dr Almada believes that the world is rich enough but it is a question of redistribution of that money. The documentary then travels to Cambodia where Nuang is seen with her two children. Her older son must collect empty bottles and cans for money as they have no other source of income. Nuang’s adopted daughter was abandoned at one month; she is now five, living in Cambodia means that she is more likely to suffer malnutrition than go to high school. Recently in Cambodia pregnant women are now offered free health care, unfortunately Nuang’s third baby; LyLy dies at just two months from unknown causes. Finally the film follows Lisa, 22, a single parent living on benefits in the final stages of her second pregnancy; her daughter Grace was born two years previously. Out of all three women Lisa is the only one that appears relatively happy with her life, saying that although people may have more than her, she is happy with what she has got. Of all four countries the UK has the longest life expectancy, many living to see their 100th birthday. The programme attempts to give a worldwide perspective on poverty, revealing the real losers in the birth right lottery. The film has rather shocking footage featuring scenes of still births and statistics about child mortality."

"Neglected pagoda on an outcrop of rock, by a river (?), with a few trees behind. People at the left of the pagoda. Not the same building shown in Thomson's negative number 285. Blue crayon lines marking border at top and left sides In southern China the photographer John Thomson came across a great many pagodas, and for him the Phoenix pagoda in Chaozhou was the best example of this type of architecture. Constructed in the 16th century, Phoenix pagoda is a seven-storey stone building with exquisite carvings. Although, wrote Thomson, this type of pagoda is generally regarded as a Buddhist monument, they are rarely seen in Cambodia or Vietnam. Thus he believed they were really intended to serve as watch-towers"

"60pp typescript memoir by Dr Muriel ""Molly"" Newhouse of her service during World War II in the RAMC, where she rose to rank of Lt Col. Initially she was posted to various camps and hospitals around the UK, but in 1944 following D-Day she went to Normandy, and after a brief return to Wales was posted to India. This is a vivid and amusing account, ""written Summer 1945"", of life in the RAMC for a woman officer during wartime, although it ends rather abruptly with a vignette of the Officers' Mess in Singapore. She notes her thwarted hopes of undertaking research and the military emphasis on the correct completion of large amounts of paperwork. The memoir is illuminating about the relationships between women in the RAMC and other women in the services (ATS, nurses, etc) and attitudes towards women as doctors in the military context. .With text of (her niece by marriage) Heather Joshi's eulogy of her at her funeral, 2000, provided for biographical information."

"Journal of Thomas North, containing a long account of his voyage to China in the SS Glenavon as ship's surgeon, 1891. The voyage of the SS Glanavon from London to China and back took from 17 April 1891-18 September 1891. During this time Thomas North found that his work as ship's surgeon was not as onerous as expected, so occupied himself by keeping a diary listing his impressions of the crew, passengers, places visited, and anything else that struck him as being interesting. The route of the ship took them through the straits of Gibraltar and the Suez canal, on to Port Said, Penang, Singapore, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Hankow, and Colombo. The rear of the volume contains patient notes relating to people treated by North at the Somerset and Bath Lunatic Asylum, Wells, a record of temperatures during the voyage, post mortem notes on a case of dysentry at Shanghai General Hospital (9th June), and some notes and rough pencil drawings made whilst on board ship."
"In 1928, Mackenzie was invited to join the Health Organisation of the League of Nations. As a member of the League, he undertook various advisory international missions, where he provided recommendations and guidance to governments on public health matters, such as the control of cholera, typhus fever and small pox. His first mission as Secretary of the Malaria Commission of the League of Nations was in Greece, advising on a pandemic of dengue. Mackenzie made recommendations to the Greek government on how to control the epidemic and how to prevent a recurrence. In 1929, he returned to Greece to carry out a general survey of the country from a public health perspective, including the study of the incidence of infectious disease in all parts of Greece. Between 1929 and 1930, Mackenzie visited Bulgaria to conduct a survey on areas by syphilis. While in Bulgaria, he met government officials to discuss the current conditions and environment and produced a report based on his findings. In 1930, Mackenzie was sent by the League of Nations to Bolivia to make recommendations for the reorganisation of the country's health services. In order to do so, MDM conducted a survey over a nine month period, focusing on diseases in the tropics of the Amazon, including malaria and dysentery. Between 1931 and 1932, Mackenzie travelled to Liberia as Special Commissioner to the Council of the League of Nations. In 1936, acting as Director of the Epidemiological Bureau of the League of Nations, Mackenzie visited Singapore to manage outbreaks of plague and cholera. As part of the League of Nations Eastern Bureau, Mackenzie collated reports from nearby countries providing local details of the existence of epidemics such as cholera and plague. This information was then distributed by the League of Nations to ship captains, pilots and doctors in ports, in order to prevent the transmission of infectious diseases between countries. In 1938, the League of Nations responded to a request from the Chinese Government to collaborate in epidemiological work, particularly for the prevention of cholera, small pox, typhus and malaria in the region. Mackenzie visited the country between 1938 and 1939 to report and advise on outbreaks of diseases triggered by the Sino-Japanese war. The papers include reports, correspondence, personal accounts, transcripts and other papers, relating to missions in Greece, Bulgaria, Bolivia, Singapore and China."

"Under this heading are included colleagues, pupils etc, in Canada, Australia and New Zealand, Singapore, South Africa and India as well as in the British Isles. This section falls into two main groups of letters. Firstly there is a group of letters B.1-B.23 from various individuals with whom ESS was associated and with whom he had a considerable amount of correspondence. It is not clear what criteria were employed in selecting out this group while other correspondents of importance have been left in the alphabetical sequence. This group has been arranged chronologically by the date of the earliest item. It should be noted that the William Sharpey material includes a number of Sharpey's own papers which were saved from destruction by ESS, as well as letters from Sharpey to ESS. The second group B.24-B.65 consists of correspondents arranged in alphabetical sequence. Although most correspondents in this series are represented by a mere one or two letters some corresponded with ESS over quite some period. For ease of handling and reference the series has been divided up into 65 files with the general reference PP/ESS/B. Each letter within each file has a number of its own. Letters from ESS's pupils Sanger BROWN and Sutherland SIMPSON are to be found under AMERICAN COLLEAGUES. Letters from a number of these correspondents are to be found in other sections of this collection."
"A dragon chair on which a Chinese medium or shaman (tongji, or tang-ki in Hokkien) sits while in possession by a God such as Sun Wu Kung (Monkey ) or No cha or others. This is connected to the popular religion of the Chinese, not to formal religion, and it is the sort of thing that was looked down upon by upper class or educated Chinese. The custom is very much alive in Singapore and you can find film of tang-ki ceremonies on YOUtube: the chairs are often shown but the version with sword blades is only shown for a moment on one. Photographs of tangki show body piercing with long skewers, striking the body with a spiked ball, tongue cutting and slashing the body with swords -- all without permanent damage, and all to show the superhuman powers of the god in the medium. As well sword- or nail-chairs, mediums sometimes climb sword ladders. ... ""I can fully believe that the chair was sold to Sir Henry [Wellcome]'s agents as a torture chair, because this would fit in with the sadistic Chinese Fu Manchu stereotype of the period.""

In Harwich, different styles of 'tent' are tried with a mass exodus from the quayside. In Cambridge, the tent self-erects at a college swimming pool. The men clamber in. Boarding proves to be difficult for one untrained man wearing a life jacket. A rope scrambling net is added; followed by an armhold; followed by a ladder. A single man proves that he can right the capsized dingy. Singapore 1950, the experiments on the dinghies continue in the tropics. The men are mustered so that they can be examined briefly in turn (they are all in good health). Rosyth 1951, despite cold external temperatures, the interior of the tents become very hot; the temperature is recorded via a series of equipment. North Sea 1951, the evacuation of a ship onto life rafts takes place. Further modifications are made to the latest raft in 1953. Experiments to address seasickness are abandoned due to exceptionally heavy seas. They resume later in a swimming pool with a wave making machine with volunteers."

"The bulk of the collection consists of correspondence: the Singers were clearly vigorous letter writers and both Charles and Dorothea had an enormous number of family, friends and acquaintances. Unfortunately many of their letters were hand written and very few carbon copies survive. Very occasionally an attempt at methodical selection and arrangement is evident: on the whole correspondence had been kept in alphabetical order, and this has been retained in the arrangement of the collection. Dorothea and Charles’ correspondence was fairly mixed (reflecting their working life together) with the exception of two distinct groups: correspondence about Dorothea’s research on alchemical manuscripts, and later correspondence about her hearing aids. The main part of the collection centres on the correspondence; this has been grouped together in a self-evident sequence: writings and biographical personal papers follow. Certain of Dorothea’s papers remained clearly distinct and these have been kept together. Section E contains a variety of material relating to Jewish refugees, which had been placed on one side by Dorothea after the war for permanent preservation. It has not been listed in detail but sorted into three broad categories. The last section, comprising additional correspondence of the Singers with Sir Zachary Cope, Sir Arthur Salusbury MacNalty and Dr F.N.L. Poynter, is not strictly part of the collection, but these groups of correspondence were given to the Institute to be placed alongside the Singer papers."

"** The original item is too fragile to be produced. The description below applies to the entire original volume, which is now spread across two microfilms (AMS/MF/174 and AMS/MF/175). Please order both films to be sure of finding material listed below. ** Letterbook consisting of copies of internal and external letters sent by the head office of Burroughs Wellcome & Co (BW&Co), Snow Hill, December 1881 - May 1897. This was a joint business letter book - with letters by Wellcome, Burroughs and the key senior managers Kirby and Sudlow. There are significant overlaps with WF/E/01/01/01 from August 1882. The Letterbook includes letters illustrating the breakdown in the business relationship of Burroughs and Wellcome (eg referring to each other as ""Mr..."" in internal memos that are being sent to each other in the same building) and also letters on the aftermath of Burroughs's death. A great deal of the correspondence relates to trade and sales, whether it is the gift of BW&Co products to notable names and institutions (eg Cecil Rhodes; British Army) or the relationship with BW&Co sales agents across the world.

"** The original item is too fragile to be produced. The description below applies to the entire original volume, which is now spread across two microfilms (AMS/MF/174 and AMS/MF/175). Please order both films to be sure of finding material listed below. ** Letterbook consisting of copies of internal and external letters sent by the head office of Burroughs Wellcome & Co (BW&Co), Snow Hill, December 1881 - May 1897. This was a joint business letter book - with letters by Wellcome, Burroughs and the key senior managers Kirby and Sudlow. There are significant overlaps with WF/E/01/01/01 from August 1882. The Letterbook includes letters illustrating the breakdown in the business relationship of Burroughs and Wellcome (eg referring to each other as ""Mr..."" in internal memos that are being sent to each other in the same building) and also letters on the aftermath of Burroughs's death. A great deal of the correspondence relates to trade and sales, whether it is the gift of BW&Co products to notable names and institutions (eg Cecil Rhodes; British Army) or the relationship with BW&Co sales agents across the world.

"** The original item is too fragile to be produced. Please order the microfiche version quoting the reference AMS/MF/174 and AMS/MF/175. ** Letterbook consisting of copies of internal and external letters sent by the head office of Burroughs Wellcome & Co (BW&Co), Snow Hill, December 1881 - May 1897. This was a joint business letter book - with letters by Wellcome, Burroughs and the key senior managers Kirby and Sudlow. There are significant overlaps with WF/E/01/01/01 from August 1882. The Letterbook includes letters illustrating the breakdown in the business relationship of Burroughs and Wellcome (eg referring to each other as ""Mr..."" in internal memos that are being sent to each other in the same building) and also letters on the aftermath of Burroughs's death. A great deal of the correspondence relates to trade and sales, whether it is the gift of BW&Co products to notable names and institutions (eg Cecil Rhodes; British Army) or the relationship with BW&Co sales agents across the world.

"The vast majority of the material relates to Dent’s research and clinical interests and falls into four main categories: correspondence files; files created around the publication of papers; lecture notes and symposium papers; and case/research notes. There are also smaller quantities dealing with other aspects of his career, such as the administration of UCH Metabolic Ward. The papers thus reflect most of Dent’s scientific and clinical interests. This research is mainly represented by the abstracted documentation which he kept with drafts of his published papers (see section E.1) and also by correspondence about cases and clinical case notes (see section C.5). To a lesser degree they also illustrate the work at the laboratory bench which underpinned much of this research. For example, a file of unidentified paper chromatograms has been preserved (C.2/10) to illustrate one of Dent’s methods of working, as described by his colleague, Heathcote, and quoted in the Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society, 1978: ‘Paper chromatograms were not to be thrown away. They were filed and, since the colours faded, the outline of each spot was drawn in and the intensity of the colour was indicated by a number.’ The way in which Dent compiled a large series of files around drafts of scientific papers also illustrates the importance of the published paper to him as a stage in the research process. In order to help make sense of the collection, a list of publications is therefore provided as a note to this collection description. An incomplete collection of reprints of Dent’s published papers may be found in section E.2 of the collection."

"Papers relating to career, scientific research, and his writings on the philosophy of science; also biographical material collected by the late Dr Robert Reid. Includes material on evolution, hereditarianism, IQ, nature vs nurture, and eugenics. This collection does not represent a complete record of Sir Peter's career. As mentioned in Lady Medawar's memoir, A Very Decided Preference pp.28-29, he was given to periodical clear-outs of papers, and thus the earlier stages of his career are less well-documented than the later years. One of the laboratory notebooks was stolen from a parked car. Some items of personal interest were returned to Lady Medawar. Duplicates and ephemera have been weeded, and routine correspondence (secretary's letters acknowledging letters received, travel arrangements, etc) have been disposed of. A large number of reprints not by Medawar and not annotated by him received in accession 317 of July 1989, have not been retained in the collection."

"This film addresses overpopulation in the Philipines and seeks to motivate public health and other government workers to re-inforce the benefits of reducing family sizes. Throughout there are scenes of impoverished urban life with the stress made on the pressure of finite resources whether health, education or quality of life. Finally, President Marcos outlines the challenge ahead which would involve tackling the Catholic church's explicit lack of support for contraception as well as the desire for large families. 4 segments."
"This film begins by showing Filippino women in labour in an over-crowded delivery room where newborns have to share tiny plastic cots immediately after birth. Illustrated by wonderful footage of the Philippines in the early 1970s we are told about the rise in population in the Philippines and how this is bringing about migration to the cities, unemployment, health problems and general poverty. Ruben Apelo, President of the Family Planning Association of the Philippines talks about how difficult it is to implement a working contraceptive policy given the strong Catholic faith of the republic. The film ends with a speech by His Excellancy Ferdinand E. Marcos, President of the Republic of the Philippines, who advocates population control and the work of the Family Planning Association."

"This film shows the new approaches to distribution and contraceptives being explored internationally by focusing on three studies of community-based distribution. Social marketing is seen at work in different settings in Sri Lanka, Philippines and Columbia. In Sri Lanka, condoms are rebranded with the name ""Joy"" to distance their association away from venereal disease. Distribution was via small local shops. Reckitt and Coleman handled the packaging. Shopkeepers are enlisted for education and information dissemination. A campaign to make the female contraceptive pill readily available was then rolled out. The film then looks at the situation in the Philippines. A family planning clinic was set up running alongside a church, Iglesia Cristo. Volunteers are shown preparing packs for distribution and then canvassing the clinic's facilities. The situation in Columbia is studied. A green flag is present outside distribution outlets for contraceptives. New adopters of contraception are called 'new acceptors'. The distributors and introducers split the proceeds from the sale of contraceptives."

"Wellcome desk calendar illustrated with tales of folklore from throughout the world. For instance, one of the examples of folklore (from South America) outlines the Aztec tradition for curing lameness of hands. This involved steeping the hands of the sufferer in water containing a bitter astringent and then placing them in an ants' nest. Another example of folklore (from India) outlines how copper earrings were worn to ward off the demons of sciatica. The folklore tales were taken from the following publications: Funk and Wagnall, Japanese Folklore, Under Augury, Dictionary of Folklore, Mythology & Legend, Under Copper; Prof C. Y.

"The film opens with a comment that family planning services have not had a big enough impact; the footage shown is from the Philippines and shows a rather chaotic clinic. The film then goes on to discuss the criteria for success for establishing a clinic. Firstly, it needs to be located in a convenient place. The waiting area should be large (very many people are shown waiting). Other aspects of administration are seen (leaflets, posters etc). A group of women are shown waiting for a film to be projected. An examining area has to be private and the facilities needed are shown. Some of the footage appears to be shot in a South American Spanish-speaking country. A vasectomy is seen through the operating room window. Patients are shown recovering from minor surgery. Female practitioners (ethnicity appears to be Indian) are shown. Procedures for disposing of post-examination supplies are described for the benefit of nurses and clinic staff. A mother and baby attending a clinic is then shown (ethnicity appears to be African). A male field worker speaks to factory workers promoting good family planning practices. Volunteers are trained. A mobile clinic with field workers is seen in action. Good practice and a respectful attitude to patients are encouraged."

"Description taken from seller's description: ""In 1803, the Spanish government began a campaign to vaccinate everyone in all its Spanish territories. The story of the Royal Philanthropic Vaccine Expedition (the so-called Balmis Expedition), is well known as one the first large-scale international public health initiatives. By 1806, many hundreds of thousands had been vaccinated, from the Viceroyalty of Peru to China and the Philippines. The epidemic resurged in Spain over the next decade, and fresh mandates were issued, including ours, in 1818, ordering all children three months of age or older to be vaccinated. The preamble to the mandate suggests that the lower classes are inherently less caring for their children and therefore bear more responsibility for the spread of the disease. The seven articles of the mandate are as follows: 1. All children of both sexes are to be vaccinated at three months of age. The parents or guardians of children whose constitutions are too weak to receive a vaccine must provide evidence to this effect from their doctors and submit it to the Board of Health. 2. Those who do not vaccinate their children or wards as per the first article are subject to fines. 3. Any child who contracts smallpox shall be quarantined in a room in their own home and cared for by someone who has been vaccinated or has already had the disease. If the child should die, the room will be chemically fumigated and sealed off. Those who contravene this article shall be fined. 4. Anyone twelve or older who contracts smallpox and cannot be cared for at home shall be transferred to a lazaretto (smallpox hospital) until they recover, and may not leave until a doctor permits it. When transfer to a lazaretto is not possible, Article 3 will be in force. When quarantine at home is not possible,quarantine at an available (general) hospital will be enforced. Those who contravene this article shall be fined. 5. Fines collected will be used to defray public health costs related to smallpox, to promote the vaccine, to pay for the cost incurred by members of the indigent population who contract smallpox,and to reward whistleblowers who reveal persons who are concealing the infected. 6. If doctors or those in the medical establishment conceal or do not report instances of the illness, they will be subject to higher fines. 7. The mandate does not supersede or abrogate laws already in place.The mandate (legally an edict) was signed by Francisco Javier Castaños Aragorri Urioste y Olavide, the 1st Duke of Bailén. Castaños, who later distinguished himself in the Napoleanic campaigns and then served as the first president of the House of Peers in Spain. Castaños is adamant in his goal of exterminating smallpox, and is clear that he will punish those who stand in the way: Cometo al zelo de las Juntas de Sanidad y Justicias el exacto cumplimiento de cuanto contienen los articulos que anteced enesperando que lo desplegaran ahora y en lo sucesivo, hasta conseguir eltotal exterminio de las viruelas, que por necesidad debe ser infalible, siel escarmiento reprime á los preocupados, y la persuasion convence a losque miran con indiferencia sus mismos hijos y el interes general de sus conciudadanos. Y para que llegue noticia y nadie pueda escusarse con la ignorancia , he mandado expedir el presente Edicto rmado de mimano y refrendado por el Secretario de S. M. y de esta Capitania General. Barcelona 23 de Mayo de 1818. Document written with direct plainness for the benefit of the populace, and intended to be posted in public places in Spain and the colonies."
"The collection contains papers related to Patrick Clavell Blount's work as an anti-fluoridation campaigner, both as an individual and through his work as Chairman of the London Anti-Fluoridation Campaign (LAFC) and later the National Anti-Fluoridation Campaign (NAFC). The material mainly consists of correspondence with both pro and anti-fluoridation campaigns and commentators, MPs and Lords. It also includes LAFC and NAFC organisational papers including meeting minutes and financial records, circulars and other items produced by Blount for LAFC and NAFC members and subscribers, and speeches, notes and articles written by Blount as both an ideas and anti-fluoridation campaigner. There is also material produced by others which was collected by Blount in his research of the subject including newspaper cuttings, reprints, pamphlets, and leaflets. Sections are organised more specifically as follows: A: Organisational papers relating to the formation and management of the LAFC and NAFC, including select meeting agendas and minutes, financial reports and correspondence re. donations, and correspondence files relating to organisational and personal disputes on the overall running of the campaign. B: LAFC and NAFC material created and published by Blount, primarily for initial circulation to members and subscribers, including circulars, press releases, fact cards, memos and donation forms; a mixture of draft and final copies. C: Papers and correspondence with individuals and other organisations collated by Blount during the course of his campaigning as reference files, grouped in a number of ways by Blount including subject, type of organisation, name and alphabetically. D: Mainly articles, reprints, leaflets and pamphlets created by others on the topic of water fluoridation, both pro and against, published in the UK, USA, Australia and New Zealand, but also includes some material from other European countries, as well as material published by the LAFC and NAFC. E: Press cuttings collected by Blount on the topic of water fluoridation, both pro and against, grouped in a number of ways by Blount including alphabetically, by mentions of LAFC, NAFC and Blount in the press, by individual and by date. F: Correspondence, drafts and notes related to speeches, articles and other published writing from Blount as a campaigner for both anti-fluoridation and his ideas campaign. Also includes copies of his two books, ""Ideas into Action"" and ""Compulsory Mass Medication"". G: File containing obituaries and messages of condolence upon the death of Patrick Blount H: File containing correspondence and copies of newspaper articles collected by Patrick Blount's son following his death. J: File containing photographs taken of Patrick Blount. Books and journals produced by others which Blount collected have been catalogued separately;full list."
"These papers reflect many different areas of Robina Addis's life and work, including her training and research; her involvement with both British and international societies and associations in the mental health field; visits abroad; lecturing, teaching and writing. After her official retirement she continued her involvement with the National Association for Mental Health, but was also able to extend her interests by working for the Save the Children Fund and other organisations, and these activities are also reflected in the collection. There are, however, many gaps in the papers. While RSA's early training and research are covered, her pre-War work in child guidance and during the Second World War are represented mainly by lecture notes and publications. Her long career in the NAMH is chronologically well covered from 1950 onwards, but the quantity of material is not great and it can be assumed that most of the papers were retained in the Association's internal filing system. With certain exceptions most of the papers representing RSA's other activities date only from the 1960s onwards and it is impossible to say what proportion of the total survives. The sequences of lecture notes and publications, do, however, seem to be fairly comprehensive."

"Dr Evans was in Vietnam in 1965, 1966-67 and 1971. He was the first leader of the British Medical Team at the Children's Hospital, ('Benh Vien Nhi Dong'), Saigon. The origins of British paediatric work were to be found in the political background: the United States of America requested some show of support (of its presence in Vietnam) by Britain. The then Prime Minister, Mr Wilson, sought advice from the Ministry of Overseas Development which suggested the scheme of supporting a childrens teaching hospital. Dr Evans was asked to visit Saigon as an adviser by the Ministry of Overseas Development (on the announcement of which he lost his appointment as Consultant Paediatrician to the Army). The scheme eventually died, mainly through lack of adequate aid at the British end. Barbara Evans also spent time in Saigon, and published a book.

"Crossing Continents tells stories, from all over the world, which go beyond news reports. This programme has a selection of highlights from coming programmes. 1) Agent Orange from the Vietnam War. Is poison still in the soil? Why are there so many severely disabled children? 2) AIDS in Zambia. 25% of the popn is affected so some people have to care for a great many orphans. 3) Israel. There is a new phenomenon of draft dodging. Profile 21 allows people to fail the medical by proving mental illness. 4)Jamaica. Jamaicans are starting to take more responsibility for their violent society. 6) Iran. A Muslim cleric has created software to save 30% of the study time to qualify as a mullah. 7) Norway.

"Part of a series of programmes in which Jim Al-Khalili talks to leading scientists about their life and work. This part features clinical scientist and doctor, Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust. For 18 years he ran the Oxford University Clinical Research Unit in Ho Chi Minh City studying and directing research in infectious diseases. He then became director of the Wellcome Trust and this is briefly introduced in terms of its size and impact, particularly internationally. Jeremy Farrar talks about his early life growing up in various countries around the world and how he became interested in clinical research during his time at university. Working as a doctor in the 1980s and experiencing treating people in the early days of HIV transmission had a profound impact on him and his decision to pursue a career in infectious diseases. He talks about his decision to go to Vietnam in 1996. Whilst he was there he was at the centre of dealing with SARS and H5N1 bird flu outbreaks which he elaborates. The first cases of H5N1 were diagnosed at the hospital in Ho Chi Minh City and Jeremy Farrar discusses how it felt to be there. He talks about how dealing with both diseases affected him, personally and professionally, and made him aware how local disease outbreaks affect us all globally. His time building up the research unit in Ho Chi Minh City is discussed, including what he hoped to achieve. There are contributions from two colleagues, HIV researcher Thuy Le in Ho Chi Minh City, and Nick White, professor of tropical medicine in Bangkok. Jeremy Farrar talks about the culture of research in Asia, and Vietnam in particular including how the politics there affect health research. The Wellcome Trust is then considered. He mentions the scope he has, as a new director, to reprioritise the direction of research should he wish to, particularly in support of international health in its broadest context. He talks about medical research funding areas generally and considers key areas of the Trust that are likely to be critical in the coming decades. These include, genomics and how this will work in areas of medical research, the brain and mental health, infectious diseases especially in relation to drug resistance, and sustainability of health and how we live, including the medical humanities. He talks too about climate change and how it is linked with societal changes. He thinks the Trust has been very forward thinking in working in the area of culture, society and the humanities in relation to science. Finally he talks about what he misses from Vietnam and in no longer being a doctor."

"In this film, we visit the Centre for Tropical Diseases in Ho Chi Min City, Vietnam, where important research is being conducted into the treatment of falciparum malaria. We first look at some typical patients with falciparum malaria, then we see the doctors assessing the Glasgow Coma Score on a patient with cerebral malaria; there is then a step by step demonstration of how to prepare and examine thin and thick blood films for malaria, with the appearance of the parasites of Plasmodium falciparum and vivax well demonstrated. Finally Keith Arnold reviews the life cycle of the parasite; discusses treatment, including the place of the traditional Chinese Artemisinin group of antimalarials; and considers the advice to be given to travellers."
"The sixth in a 10-part series investigating diseases from around the globe. Each programme features a single disease and looks at attempts to develop treatments that are effective and affordable to the world's poor who make up the majority of the victims. This part features Hookworm, the most prevalent of parasitic infections; it is estimated that a third of the world's population has some form of helminth infection. We visit Vietnam where problems with helminth infections are common. The devastating effects of hookworm infestation on members of a village community are shown. Unicef are attempting to establish an extensive sanitation project and the World Health Organisation now undertakes a mass distribution of de-worming pills to schools on a regular basis but many people in the community don't benefit from this. Professor Hotez is working on an anti-parasitic vaccine, a vaccine against hookworm."
"BAFTA Award-wining series on the 20th century rise and influence of science and technology, with particular reference to the U.S.A., Russia and Britain. The series has scarcely any medical content but is extremely well done and is of the greatest interest as a chronicle of 20th century delusions. ""Part 2: To the Brink of Eternity"" The U.S. government's RAND corporation's use of science and technology in the Cold War with the Soviet Union broached new frontiers of unreality. Futurists, games theorists, and all kinds of strategists presented pictures of events that were unrecognisable to those actually involved in running the country and commanding the U.S. Army in Vietnam. Ronald Reagan took refuge from the complexities of science in a mixture of fantasy and simplicity fed to him by the science fiction writers whose advice he sought on running America's defence system."
"The world is full of alleged dangers - mobile phones, landfill sites etc. Sir Richard Doll explains how he had no real idea of what caused lung cancer - cars? tar on the road? before smoking became most likely. Two methods epidemiologists use are 1) cohort studies, and 2) case/control studies. It can be difficult to establish that control groups are truly similar. Doll found as much as a fifty-fold increase in risk for smokers. Larry Beason has studied non-smokers to find out if industrial pollutants is associated with lung cancer. Doll is accused of downplaying the effects of industrial pollutants or pesticides. Attempts have been made to establish a connection between Agent Orange and medical problems in Vietnam veterans. Doll has supported the manufacturer. Epidemiologists argue about fluoride in drinking water causing increased cancer. The programme points out various pitfalls in epidemiology."
"In the correspondence Pontecorvo outlines some of his worries and questions relating to the post at Harvard, such as funding, responsibilities, research grants, and retirement prospects, and Professor McGeorge Bundy does his best to answer each query. They also discuss the composition and future of the Department of Biology at Harvard. At one point in their long discussion Pontecorvo writes to let Professor McGeorge Bundy know that he has been offered the Chair of Genetics at Cambridge but ""the conditions are so incredible that the chance of my accepting it is rather small."". In his next letter he mentions ""Cambridge is off. I have failed to make them be sensible in respect of the facilities for Genetics"".In the end Pontecorvo turned down the position at Harvard stating that, ""my wife and I have come to the conclusion that we are now too old for the change""."
"Set of 15 posters produced in 1971 when anxiety about possible attack from both America and the Soviet Union was being spread throughout China by propaganda such as this. Behind the scenes, however, the Chinese government had already decided to throw in its lot with the Americans as against the Russians, who were perceived as the greater threat. After the two bloody border conflicts between the Soviet Union and China at Zhenbao (Damansky) Island in March and August 1969, there were reports that the Soviets were considering a pre-emptive nuclear strike against China: four marshals advising Mao Zedong emphasized the need for Beijing to prepare for a ""worst-case scenario"". President Nixon, after his election in 1969, declared his wish for America to have good relations with all countries, not excluding China. His remarks were taken up by Mao, leading to a secret visit to Beijing by Dr Henry Kissinger in July 1971 and an open one in October 1971, laying the foundations for President Nixon's visit in February 1972. In the negotiations with the United States Mao stressed the necessity of American withdrawal from Vietnam. The posters therefore reflect Chinese fears of nuclear attack by the Soviet Union, presented for propaganda purposes as fears of attack from the USA (Chen, op. cit., pp. 240-244; Yang, op. cit.)"

"The collection is roughly split between Sir Harold Himsworth's scientific career and his subsequent role within the Medical Research Council. Section A, entitled 'Laboratory notes' is a compilation of Sir Harold Himsworth's experimental work on diabetes and liver function and disease. Series 1 and 2 comprise his experimental notebooks on experiments carried out on animal and human subjects. Some of the records in A/2 have therefore been restricted or closed to due the sensitive nature of the material regarding the human subjects. Series 3 entitled 'Research papers' is a mixture of experimental notes, calculations and notes which again has been restricted due to sensitive content. The final part of section A, 'Collected Articles' is a series of published academic articles written by Himsworth which cover both his experimental work and his role within the Medical Research Council. Section B relates to his role as Secretary of the Medical Research Council from 1949 to 1968. The bulk of this section is comprised of collected annual reports from this era along with specialist publications on the affect of nuclear weapons and another on CS gas that Himsworth was actively involved in producing. The rest of the series is comprised of memorandum, correspondences and related articles associated with his role as secretary of the MRC. Additionally, B/4 is a series of notes that Himsworth compiled whilst touring the African MRC stations in 1951. Section C covers all the collected papers regarding the Northern Ireland enquiry on the affect of CS gas launched after the public outcry of the use of the gas in Londonderry in 1968. This section contains correspondence that Himsworth received and sent debating the toxicity of the gas, with several letters and enquiries being received from the US and France relating to its use within the Vietnam conflict and the Paris Riots. There is a full series of official minutes from the committee and a large assortment of scientific articles relating to CS gas with a separate section relating to French research and reports. Section D entitled 'Social Science Research Council' is the collected papers, minutes and itineraries relating to the Social Science Research Council (SSRC) Warwick Conference, 1968. Amongst the reports there are several review papers on the state of anthropology, sociology and psychology research in Britain. Section F comprises of 'University College Hospital: War Time Reforms to Medical Education' with papers, reports, articles and correspondences related to Sir Harold Himsworth's interest and campaign to reform medical education during the first few years of the Second World War. The last section, G, is a general assortment of items that were personally collected by Sir Harold Himsworth. G/1 is split between medical history articles and miscellaneous scientific articles; G/2 are the collected obituaries that Himsworth collected over his lifetime; G/3 are draft and printed public addresses by Sir Harold and the final item is a copy of his philosophical publication Scientific Knowledge and Philosophical Thought ."

"The third in a four-part series, presented by Michael Mosley, in which CGI footage is used to show the workings of the human body. In this part, Mosley traces our neurological development from birth to adulthood, revealing that it takes twenty years for the human brain to mature. We see the world through the perspective of a newborn and that of a girl with neurological difficulties. Moken sea gypsy children train themselves to see clearly underwater and a Vietnamese girl can speak eleven languages fluently. Different phases of emotional development, particularly between the ages of eleven and twenty, are discussed as these are times when many of the earlier brain connections are lost in the process of remodelling and growing up."
"Some animals have a remarkable ability to heal themselves. Could these methods work for humans? The VIETNAMESE POT BELLIED PIG develops skin cancers, some 4cm across. These could be fatal in a human. However, frequently these tumours suddenly disappear. How does it happen? These pigs have some special immune system. FROGS, too, can heal themselves from serious abdominal wounds, even when in a squalid tank. Michael Zazlov, was astonished by his frogs, whose wounds did not fester, and has discovered they have chemicals at the wound site - an antibiotic he has called 'meganin'. He is trying to exploit this commercially. Do animals have special knowledge about medicinally useful plants. Manuel Arguillan investigated chimps eating the Aspinia plant with its hairy leaves rolled up. He found antibiotics which may affect nematodes. Richard Rangam disagrees and thinks the hairy leaf traps nematodes in the gut, so it is a physical effect, not chemical. George Lazano is totally sceptical as there are no controlled experiments. Andrew Wighton studies gorillas eating the Venonia plant. It is possible that generations of a successful species have selected some plants prophylactically."

"In the second of two programmes, Peter Taylor considers the development of electronic or e-cigarettes, which are claimed to be far safer than conventional cigarettes. The tobacco industry is pouring vast amounts of money into the devices, which could make smoking socially acceptable again. Yet some view e-cigarettes as a smokescreen, deflecting negative press from the industry’s core business of selling tobacco. An estimated 2 million ‘vapers’ currently use e-cigarettes in the UK. British American Tobacco (BAT) was the first to launch the products in the UK. The company spends 160 million annually on developing new, safer products. According to BAT’s Scientific Director David O’Reilly, the nicotine contained in e-cigarettes is no more harmful than a cup of coffee – a claim refuted by leading paediatrician Sir Cyril Chantler, who cites the drug’s addictive properties. The rise of e-cigarettes has outpaced regulation, prompting a return to previously banned marketing outlets including sports sponsorship, television commercials and product placement in music videos. Mike Daube from the Australian Council on Smoking on Health is in no doubt; e-cigarettes are ‘a weapon of mass distraction’ and marketing dream for tobacco companies. The UK’s largest brand, E-Lites, sponsor Worcester Warriors rugby club. Taylor challenges the company’s Chief Executive, Adrian Everett, accusing him of normalising smoking. Yet e-cigarettes have helped many smokers to quit. In a deprived area of Derbyshire, where smoking rates are double the national average, GP Dr John Ashcroft has set up his own shop to sell the products. As yet, there is no direct evidence that e-cigarettes are a gateway to smoking for young people. But the anti-tobacco lobby are finding it hard to trust an industry that has lied and disassembled for so many years. Meanwhile in the developing world where 80% of smokers live, marketing restrictions are limited or non-existent. Taylor travels to East Timor, the country with the highest smoking rate for men in the world. Jorge Luna of the World Health Organisation says that smoking rates amongst young people are rising year on year. Taylor interviews the country’s Prime Minister Xanana Gusmão, who has no plans to introduce legislation, despite his Australian wife’s role as an anti-tobacco campaigner for UNESCO. In East Timor’s schools, children as young as 10 smoke openly. Taylor considers the history of cigarette adverting. The world’s biggest tobacco company Phillip Morris has recently launched a controversial new campaign, ‘Be Marlborough’, aimed unashamedly at young people. The campaign was launched in Germany, where cigarette advertising is still permitted in cinemas. An internet campaign swiftly followed. Although Marlborough claims its models are over 30, their clothing and poses resemble those of teenagers. The campaign was subsequently banned by a German court, but has since been rolled out worldwide. Taylor journeys to Argentina, which has the highest rates of smoking in South America. While the country has signed up to the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, it has never been ratified. The industry is quick to exploit loopholes in legislation, expanding point of sale displays to permit extensive advertising. Although smoking is not permitted in public places, the law is not enforced. Argentina is the second largest tobacco producer in South America, which may explain the industry’s relative freedom. In neighbouring Uruguay, the climate is rather more hostile. The country has the most stringent anti-smoking legislation on the continent, prompting Phillip Morris to sue for an estimated 2 billion dollars on IP grounds over health warnings on cigarette packaging. Former President and oncologist Tabaré Vázquez, who introduced the ruling, describes smoking as the worst pandemic that mankind has endured. Australia is fighting a similar legal battle, and BAT is primed to sue should plain packaging be introduced in the UK. The programme concludes with footage from Taylor’s previous documentaries on the topic, dating back 40 years."

"Two young men and a girl standing in the doorway of a brick building. Large baulks of wood on the left hand side Within the Qing empire, Amoy men were known to be rebels or 'southern rascals', who frequently caused problems for the authorities. Although the Manchu had finally conquered the region, many local people continued to maintain a separate identity. Not only did they speak a different dialect, they dressed in a unique style. Here two men wear turbans, which hide the queues (""pigtails"") imposed on them by the Manchu. According to Thomson, both men were local coolies. At this time many such men left to work in America or in plantations in Southeast Asia."

"This subseries consists of reprints, correspondence, clinical data, and notes regarding publication related to distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA), with special reference to tropical dRTA. Dr. Wrong studied dRTA for much of his career, from the 1950s onwards, and his work on Southeast Asian Ovalocytosis and Nephrocalcinosis are very much related to this research. The items within this subseries are titled as originally labelled by Dr. Wrong unless otherwise noted."
"This subseries consists of patient files, belonging to families, individuals and assorted groups, relating to Dr. Wrong's clinical research mainly in the areas of Dent's Disease, nephrocalcinosis, distal Renal Tubular Acidosis (dRTA), and Southeast Asian Ovalocytosis. These files, given their personal and clinical nature, are all closed in compliance with the Data Protection Act. Dr. Wrong maintained relationships with patients throughout his professional career and in a 2009 interview with his daughter emphasized that medical scientists must keep up personal links with their patients."

According to John Thomson, the people in the Amoy area were quite poor: an able-bodied man earned five pence a day, while skilled workmen were only paid about eight pence. The hard life forced many to seek work abroad, for Chinese labourers were highly rated in America and Southeast Asian countries"
"This series is arranged according to specific areas of study that comprised the bulk of Dr. Wrong's clinical research. Dr. Wrong began his career with an interest in 'salt and water' medicine, meaning studying the simple compounds that are critical to life, which led him to the kidney and gut as they control the intake and excretion of such compounds. This series reveals Wrong's particular interests in and contributions to the understanding of: The excretion of acid in renal disease (basis for Wrong's citation classic) distal Renal Tubular Acidosis (dRTA) Nephrocalcinosis In-vivo faecal dialysis Dent's Disease Southeast Asian Ovalocytosis Resins and anion exchangers Dr. Wrong's clinical and research interests often overlapped because much of his scientific work required relationships with and data from patients, and as a result patient files are highly integrated throughout this series."

"These conjoined-twins are the original Siamese twins, from whom the name derives. Born at Maklong near Bankok in Siam in about May 1811, of Chinese extraction; they were taken to America and then England in 1829, where they were exhibited causing great excitement.

After visiting the principal cities in Europe they returned to America to settle as farmers in North Carolina, adopting the name of Bunker and marrying two sisters who bore each of them many healthy children. In 1869 they made another tour through Europe and took advice from eminent surgeons of Britain and France on the feasibility of being separated, with no ultimate conclusion. After having returned to their dual families (which they kept in separate houses) Chang developed bronchitis, which led to their death in mid-January 1874#They are shown indulging in an English diet.
