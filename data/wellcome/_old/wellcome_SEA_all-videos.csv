In a rural community in Indonesia, there is a puppet show to communicate the message to children and in youth clubs in tandem with cultural activities in order to promote the idea of small families being the social norm. In a factory in Malaysia, young female workers have a lecture on contraception at lunchtime. In a post-natal clinic, new mothers are given advice. There is a mobile clinic which travels around Kuala Lumpur. At a rubber plantation, family planning advice is provided alongside general medical care. In Singapore, already densely populated, the focus is on the young - teachers are lectured to provide information to their pupils. Young people living in hostels are found to be lacking in understanding human reproduction and family planning - they receive lectures too. Thailand also has a significant population problem especially around the shanty towns around Bangkok - night time film shows and clinics are provided to this community. Local health visitors visit rural families in their homes. Local community distribution advisers disseminate information to the rural poor; they have a more challenging task of communicating the desirability of smaller families to these communities. The injectable contraceptive which offers 12 week family planning is popular amongst some women.</p>",,,,,,https://wellcomecollection.org/works/fbughtrg

It centres around the 'true story' of a young Malayan woman, Ah Moi (played by Miss Mary Chai) who makes contact with a British Red Cross Nurse, Miss Jean Wright (played by herself), when her brother is very ill. Jean Wright is our narrator. The film has a highly melodramatic (and rather intrusive) music sound track. The young boy has a high fever and is being nursed by his mother. A glimpse of traditional life is shown. Later, in the health clinic, we see public health posters of the day on the walls, re-inforcing messages about TB etc. The young woman is seen assisting the nurse in her clinic. A new training scheme is described and Ah Moi is then trained to be a full-time nurse. Some of the work of the traveling Red Cross clinics are shown as it journeys around the rural regions of Malaya. Ah Moi travels back to her village, fully trained, to a rapturous welcome.</p>",,,,,,https://wellcomecollection.org/works/j5npf4vt

But confidence was shaken even before the end of that decade with the death of seven workers at a polio vaccine laboratory from Marburg's virus. In 1969 the deadly lassa fever, whose viral source is the rat, was brought to Britain from Sierra Leone. From 1976 onwards, outbreaks of disease caused by the highly infectious ebola virus killed hundreds in Africa. Increasing global travel meant that no disease could be confined to its country of origin. The Heathrow Health Control Unit screens immigrants for tuberculosis. Russia and Eastern Europe are badly affected by TB and the multi drug resistant strain can flare up anywhere in the world. Conference visitors to the US came home with Legionaires disease. Travel within cities on over crowded transport may spread disease. Animals are a chief source of infection: an influenza like illness originating in chickens was passed to humans in Hong Kong in 1997 and a disease originating in pigs killed those working with the animals in 1999 in Malaysia, both outbreaks necessitating the slaughter of the countries chickens and pigs. In Britain, children caught e-coli related illnesses from farm visits. AIDS, identified in 1980, has killed 16 million people. War, trade and travel exported it from Africa and the Western lifestyle encouraged it to flourish. The HIV virus mutates to evade control by drugs and there is still no prospect of a vaccine.</p>

Oxana Malaya was left outside by her alcoholic parents as a toddler, so crawled into a kennel for warmth and spent more time with dogs than humans, so grew up behaving more like a dog than a child.  Dramatic reconstruction illustrates the story of Victor, the first scientifically recorded case of a wild child, discovered in France in 1800.  The experiments of Winthrop Kellogg and Harry Harlow, both involving the early development of monkeys, are briefly covered.  The case of Jeannie Wiley is explained in detail: she was discovered as a 13-year-old in a house where she had been kept in total isolation by her parents, strapped to a potty chair by day and kept in a cage at night.  She was unable to walk and was never spoken to, so was unable to speak.  Child Psychologist James Kent and Professor of Linguistics Susan Curtiss talk of their work with Jeannie.  In the Ukraine town of Mirny, a 4-year-old boy called Edik who grew up with stray dogs is now living with a foster family.  James Law, Professor of Language and Communication, visits Edik to evaluate his prospects.  Although, with help, rehabilitated feral children are gradually able to empathise and learn single words, they will not be able to learn spoken language and grammar past the age of 4 years.  They will probably have social and emotional problems and difficulties in forming personal relationships.  The programme ends by pointing out that we should be inspired by these children because in spite of the horrendous treatment they have had, they have a kernal of humanity that will not be crushed, and are still willing to put out a hand and touch a new person.</p>",,,,,,https://wellcomecollection.org/works/kjykycnw

The water supplies of small Chinese towns were infected with laboratory-grown bacteria as an experiment and samples were taken from victims who were then murdered.  Chinese men were also rounded up for use in germ warfare experiments, which included anthrax spores, bubonic plague and glanders.  The Japanese also set up germ warfare centres in Manchuria, Thailand and Singapore.  Throughout the 1940s they field-tested bombs containing anthrax spores and even collected plague-infected fleas which were packed into bombs and dropped over China.  Britain experimented with anthrax in 1942 on the island of Gruinard.  There is film of these experiments, in which sheep were used to test the spread and toxicity of the anthrax organism.  However, germ 'bombs' were never put into mass production in Britain.  Japanese efforts to produce a war-winning weapon were finally defeated by the US atom bomb; and after World War II germ warfare research became a serious business in the US.

The WHO was first alerted by Dr. Carlo Obani of Hanoi who was alarmed at the symptoms of one of his hospital patients.  Dr. Obani was unaware that the virus was already spreading through the hospital and in a short time, 60 patients died from it.  Dr. Obani also became fatally infected.  There had been rumours of a fatal disease spreading through Guandong, China, but China issued no warning and took no action.  By the time the urgency of the situation was recognised, the virus had already spread across the border to Hong Kong and from Hong Kong its route was open to the rest of the world.  At WHO Headquarters, Geneva, the Global Awareness and Response Unit took the unusual step of implementing its war plan.  As well as Hong King and Vietnam, Singapore and Canada were already experiencing cases of SARS.  This was the name give to it by the WHO.  They announced a worldwide alert and sent out guidelines to hospitals.  Even as they were setting up these precautions, new cases were identified in Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand and Germany.  It was an urgent matter to identify the virus so the world's top microbiologists were asked to co-operate with each other in the search.  The index case - the first person to contract the illness - was identified, Dr. Jianlun Liu, a Chinese doctor, who had carried the virus to Hong Kong.  Method of tranmission was established and a breakthrough occurred with the isolation of the virus from a patient.  It proved to be a corona virus which normally causes nothing worse than the common cold in humans, but this one had changed; probably an animal virus, it was likely that it had jumped species in Guandong, China, where people live at close quarters with their livestock.  The human immune system is unprepared for the onslaught of new virus and the results can be lethal.  There is no antidote for SARS; patients can be supported but ultimately the strenght of their immune systems resovles the battle one way or another.  Four weeks after the start of the outbreak the WHO had identified the virus and its likely origin.  But the disease was still spreading and there was doubt as to whether the WHO was in control of the outbreak.  As panic mounted, however, the WHO's tactics began to take effect.  Countries co-ordinated their resistance; Singapore screened everyone entering and leaving the country; hospitals screened patients, doctors and visitors and in Toronto 10,000 people were asked to go into voluntary quarantine.  A medical team in Canada cracked the virus's genetic code and the virus was found to be barely mutating (unlike the HIV virus).  If it remains stable there is a chance of developing a vaccine - but not in the near future.  China's outbreak proved to be far greater than the country had admitted, but even so, the worst is now know about SARS and its death rate is lower than in severe outbreaks of influenza.  The task is now to contain it within China, with the aim of eradicating it.  This programme was filmed in Hanoi, Guandong, Hong Kong, Geneva, Ontario and Toronto.  Contributors include Dr. Mike Ryan (Global Awareness and Response Unit, WHO), Dr. Klaus Stohr (influenza specialist, WHO), Dr. Sheila Basrur (Medical Office of Health, Toronto), Dr. Mike Leahy (virologist).</p>",,,,,,https://wellcomecollection.org/works/tub6g485

Television Service']",2016.,,,['English'],"<p>Presented by Professor Alice Roberts, this programme explores how recent research and genetic techniques have given us insight into the four distinct groups of humans who lived on the planet at the same time as ourselves; examining the complexity of human evolution. Roberts starts with the Neanderthals, travelling to Gibraltar where Prof Clive Finlayson of the Gibraltar Museum has been studying a cave system which contains the final refuge of the Neanderthals. Finlayson explains how the stereotypes regarding Neanderthals have been proven wrong  evidence shows they were not only very cultured, but even capable of abstract thought, an ability that was previously thought to be exclusive to Homo sapiens. Professor Chris Stringer of the Natural History Museum, who has spent the last 30 years investigating the similarities and differences between modern humans and Neanderthals, explains that the two groups shared much of the same behaviour. With master flint knapper John Lord, Stringer looks at the tools Neanderthals used, which were the result of an exchange of ideas between the two groups. These interactions between Neanderthals and modern humans also helped our ancestors learn how to deal with the colder temperatures outside Africa. Professor Svante Pääbo, a geneticist from the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, then recounts how the excavation of a small finger bone in a cave in Siberia led to his team discovering the genome of an entirely new human group, which they called the Denisovans. So did modern humans come in contact with the Denisovans? The discovery of modern human teeth in Daoxian in China enabled archaeologist Dr Maria Martinón-Torres of UCL and her colleagues at the Chinese Academy of Sciences to date the move out of Africa at around 100,000 years ago. This means that our ancestors would have been living in Asia and Europe at the same time as Denisovans and Neanderthals. Anthropologists Dr Laura Shackelford and Dr Fabrice Demeter then recount the discovery of the third extinct human group, Homo floresiensis, in the small island of Flores in Indonesia. This species were nicknamed hobbits due to their small size, the result of island dwarfism. But since so many human groups have been discovered, Professor Roberts asks the pressing question  why did Homo sapiens survive, when all these other groups died out? Professor Stringer discusses the environmental factors that led to the extinction of Neanderthals, and Dr Janet Kelso of the Max Planck Institute explains how the lack of genetic diversity would have been a major factor as well. However, genetic research has allowed us to realise that present-day human beings actually share some DNA with these extinct groups, which Dr Kelso explains was the result of interbreeding. Her team were able to analyse DNA from people all over the world and concluded that those from within Africa generally lacked Neanderthal DNA, whereas people living outside of Africa often did have it as their ancestors had come in contact with Neanderthal groups. They even found traces of Denisovan DNA, particularly among Papua New Guineans, Aboriginal Australians, and Tibetans. Most recently, a fifth Hominin group was discovered by Professor Joshua Akey, a geneticist at the University of Washington. Very little is known about this group as no fossil evidence exists, and thus far they are known simply as an Archaic African group whose DNA can only be found in some parts of central Africa. Professor Roberts explains that all of these recent discoveries have forced us to completely reimagine our linear view of human evolution, and that genetics has made a huge difference to the study of our species.</p>",,,,,,https://wellcomecollection.org/works/gtkgeqzk

This part looks at how the way we inhabit the earth is leading to mass extinction and how we've struggled to understand and accept the full implications of Darwin's legacy. Marr looks back at how Darwin's theory of natural selection upset the Victorian people of his tme and led to his fears at publishing his research. However, in the Indonesian jungle, naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace was reaching similar conclusions to Darwin. He wrote to Darwin and Darwin was finally impelled to publish. Following this, Ernst Heckel founded the science of ecology; Wallace noted the way in which extinction could be induced by the interference of man rather than being a natural part of evolution. Darwin's final book was on worms and showed how vital the earthworm is to our lives. The effects of industrialisation led to huge concerns about our changing relationship with nature; William Morris, in particular, campaigned to save the beauty of the English countryside. But it wasn't until the arrival of moth enthusiast James W Tutt that Darwin's theory was connected to the effect of industrialisation on evolution. His discovery showed that in industrialised areas, the black version of the peppered moth survived and increased, while the paler variety became extinct. This provided proof that the behaviour of humankind on their environment could directly influence the path of evolution. Other ecological studies ensued, leading to Rachel Carson's publication of 'Silent Spring,' which looked into the dangers of pesticides; a book now regarded as the original battle cry for the modern environmental movement. James Lovelock expanded Darwinian theory to describe a global ecosystem based on biological feedback. He called this the Gaia hypothesis. This coupled with the first view of our planet taken from the surfaceof the earth, led to the beginnings of environmentalism.</p>",,,,,,https://wellcomecollection.org/works/efs6djnt

The documentary is part of a BBC series; ‘Why Poverty?’ and is a cross-media event, spanning 70 broadcasters in 180 countries. The main focus of the series is; why do one billion people globally live in poverty? The documentary opens by posing the question ‘Is it worse to be born poor or die poor?’ Following the pregnancies and births of four women, all of whom would be defined as poor within their respective countries, the documentary discusses the ‘birth right lottery’; depending on your country of birth, the opportunities available to you, whether you are going to thrive or struggle, depends on where you were born. The documentary follows Starr, a 37 year old married mother of four living in San Francisco, California. Although her baby Billy-Jean has a life expectancy of 78, the United States has one of the worst child mortality rates in the developed world. Starr is shown attending the San Francisco Prenatal Programme, set up by Martha Ryan 22 years previously. In its first year the programme had taken into its care 72 expectant mothers; this year that number had reached 517. Ryan believes that this is evidence of a growing gap between those who have and those who have not in American society. The program then moves to Sierra Leone where Hawa is expecting her fifth child. According to the documentary, nineteen of the twenty worst countries to be born into are situated in Africa; Sierra Leone is at the bottom of the table. According to statistics, in Sierra Leone the average life span is just 49 and the country suffers from a high child mortality rate. Visiting the Gondama Referral Centre, Dr Philip De Almada and Dr Claire Fotheringham tell of their aim to reduce the maternal mortality rate by 75%; from 1 in 8 to 1 in 25. Dr Fotheringham worked out that it cost as little as €1.7 per mother for their treatment and care. Dr Almada believes that the world is rich enough but it is a question of redistribution of that money. The documentary then travels to Cambodia where Nuang is seen with her two children. Her older son must collect empty bottles and cans for money as they have no other source of income. Nuang’s adopted daughter was abandoned at one month; she is now five, living in Cambodia means that she is more likely to suffer malnutrition than go to high school. Recently in Cambodia pregnant women are now offered free health care, unfortunately Nuang’s third baby; LyLy dies at just two months from unknown causes. Finally the film follows Lisa, 22, a single parent living on benefits in the final stages of her second pregnancy; her daughter Grace was born two years previously. Out of all three women Lisa is the only one that appears relatively happy with her life, saying that although people may have more than her, she is happy with what she has got. Of all four countries the UK has the longest life expectancy, many living to see their 100th birthday. The programme attempts to give a worldwide perspective on poverty, revealing the real losers in the birth right lottery. The film has rather shocking footage featuring scenes of still births and statistics about child mortality.</p>",,,,,,https://wellcomecollection.org/works/tfew5r2q

Shopkeepers are enlisted for education and information dissemination. A campaign to make the female contraceptive pill readily available was then rolled out. The film then looks at the situation in the Philippines. A family planning clinic was set up running alongside a church, Iglesia Cristo. Volunteers are shown preparing packs for distribution and then canvassing the clinic's facilities. The situation in Columbia is studied.

The film then goes on to discuss the criteria for success for establishing a clinic. Firstly, it needs to be located in a convenient place. The waiting area should be large (very many people are shown waiting). Other aspects of administration are seen (leaflets, posters etc). A group of women are shown waiting for a film to be  projected. An examining area has to be private and the facilities needed are shown. Some of the footage appears to be shot in a South American Spanish-speaking country. A vasectomy is seen through the operating room window. Patients are shown recovering from minor surgery. Female practitioners (ethnicity appears to be Indian) are shown. Procedures for disposing of post-examination supplies are described for the benefit of nurses and clinic staff. A mother and baby attending a clinic is then shown (ethnicity appears to be African). A male field worker speaks to factory workers promoting good family planning practices. Volunteers are trained. A mobile clinic with field workers is seen in action. Good practice and a respectful attitude to patients are encouraged.</p>",,,,,,https://wellcomecollection.org/works/zvdckt6a

The tobacco industry is pouring vast amounts of money into the devices, which could make smoking socially acceptable again. Yet some view e-cigarettes as a smokescreen, deflecting negative press from the industry’s core business of selling tobacco. An estimated 2 million ‘vapers’ currently use e-cigarettes in the UK. British American Tobacco (BAT) was the first to launch the products in the UK. The company spends 160 million annually on developing new, safer products. According to BAT’s Scientific Director David O’Reilly, the nicotine contained in e-cigarettes is no more harmful than a cup of coffee – a claim refuted by leading paediatrician Sir Cyril Chantler, who cites the drug’s addictive properties.  The rise of e-cigarettes has outpaced regulation, prompting a return to previously banned marketing outlets including sports sponsorship, television commercials and product placement in music videos. Mike Daube from the Australian Council on Smoking on Health is in no doubt; e-cigarettes are ‘a weapon of mass distraction’ and marketing dream for tobacco companies. The UK’s largest brand, E-Lites, sponsor Worcester Warriors rugby club. Taylor challenges the company’s Chief Executive, Adrian Everett, accusing him of normalising smoking. Yet e-cigarettes have helped many smokers to quit. In a deprived area of Derbyshire, where smoking rates are double the national average, GP Dr John Ashcroft has set up his own shop to sell the products.  As yet, there is no direct evidence that e-cigarettes are a gateway to smoking for young people. But the anti-tobacco lobby are finding it hard to trust an industry that has lied and disassembled for so many years. Meanwhile in the developing world where 80% of smokers live, marketing restrictions are limited or non-existent. Taylor travels to East Timor, the country with the highest smoking rate for men in the world. Jorge Luna of the World Health Organisation says that smoking rates amongst young people are rising year on year. Taylor interviews the country’s Prime Minister Xanana Gusmão, who has no plans to introduce legislation, despite his Australian wife’s role as an anti-tobacco campaigner for UNESCO. In East Timor’s schools, children as young as 10 smoke openly. Taylor considers the history of cigarette adverting. The world’s biggest tobacco company Phillip Morris has recently launched a controversial new campaign, ‘Be Marlborough’, aimed unashamedly at young people. The campaign was launched in Germany, where cigarette advertising is still permitted in cinemas. An internet campaign swiftly followed. Although Marlborough claims its models are over 30, their clothing and poses resemble those of teenagers. The campaign was subsequently banned by a German court, but has since been rolled out worldwide. Taylor journeys to Argentina, which has the highest rates of smoking in South America. While the country has signed up to the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, it has never been ratified. The industry is quick to exploit loopholes in legislation, expanding point of sale displays to permit extensive advertising. Although smoking is not permitted in public places, the law is not enforced. Argentina is the second largest tobacco producer in South America, which may explain the industry’s relative freedom. In neighbouring Uruguay, the climate is rather more hostile. The country has the most stringent anti-smoking legislation on the continent, prompting Phillip Morris to sue for an estimated 2 billion dollars on IP grounds over health warnings on cigarette packaging. Former President and oncologist Tabaré Vázquez, who introduced the ruling, describes smoking as the worst pandemic that mankind has endured. Australia is fighting a similar legal battle, and BAT is primed to sue should plain packaging be introduced in the UK. The programme concludes with footage from Taylor’s previous documentaries on the topic, dating back 40 years.</p>",,,,,,https://wellcomecollection.org/works/pq84mnvm
