In a rural community in Indonesia, there is a puppet show to communicate the message to children and in youth clubs in tandem with cultural activities in order to promote the idea of small families being the social norm. In a factory in Malaysia, young female workers have a lecture on contraception at lunchtime. In a post-natal clinic, new mothers are given advice. There is a mobile clinic which travels around Kuala Lumpur. At a rubber plantation, family planning advice is provided alongside general medical care. In Singapore, already densely populated, the focus is on the young - teachers are lectured to provide information to their pupils. Young people living in hostels are found to be lacking in understanding human reproduction and family planning - they receive lectures too. Thailand also has a significant population problem especially around the shanty towns around Bangkok - night time film shows and clinics are provided to this community. Local health visitors visit rural families in their homes. Local community distribution advisers disseminate information to the rural poor; they have a more challenging task of communicating the desirability of smaller families to these communities. The injectable contraceptive which offers 12 week family planning is popular amongst some women.",0,,

Jean Wright is our narrator. The film has a highly melodramatic (and rather intrusive) music sound track. The young boy has a high fever and is being nursed by his mother. A glimpse of traditional life is shown. Later, in the health clinic, we see public health posters of the day on the walls, re-inforcing messages about TB etc. The young woman is seen assisting the nurse in her clinic. A new training scheme is described and Ah Moi is then trained to be a full-time nurse. Some of the work of the traveling Red Cross clinics are shown as it journeys around the rural regions of Malaya.

Wellcome,q6z37zmn,b15600142,,,['Malaysia'],New killer diseases.,"By the 1960s, with the defeat of smallpox, polio and tuberculosis, people were confident that the days of deadly infectious diseases were over. But confidence was shaken even before the end of that decade with the death of seven workers at a polio vaccine laboratory from Marburg's virus. In 1969 the deadly lassa fever, whose viral source is the rat, was brought to Britain from Sierra Leone. From 1976 onwards, outbreaks of disease caused by the highly infectious ebola virus killed hundreds in Africa. Increasing global travel meant that no disease could be confined to its country of origin. The Heathrow Health Control Unit screens immigrants for tuberculosis. Russia and Eastern Europe are badly affected by TB and the multi drug resistant strain can flare up anywhere in the world. Conference visitors to the US came home with Legionaires disease. Travel within cities on over crowded transport may spread disease. Animals are a chief source of infection: an influenza like illness originating in chickens was passed to humans in Hong Kong in 1997 and a disease originating in pigs killed those working with the animals in 1999 in Malaysia, both outbreaks necessitating the slaughter of the countries chickens and pigs. In Britain, children caught e-coli related illnesses from farm visits. AIDS, identified in 1980, has killed 16 million people. War, trade and travel exported it from Africa and the Western lifestyle encouraged it to flourish. The HIV virus mutates to evade control by drugs and there is still no prospect of a vaccine. A documentary on the arrival of new deadly diseases from other parts of the world as a consequence of increased global travel and trade.",1,,

The Cooper family were prominent in local society and economy and there are many specifically personal and local history items held in the archive. * 'Brockwell Hall', Herne Hill - site of the Wellcome Physiological Research Laboratories from 1897 -c.1921. * Dartford Chemical Works from 1888- previously 'Phoenix Paper Mills', the site included 'Kepler Wharf'. Nearby was the 'Wellcome Club & Institute'. * Euston - The Wellcome Building 183 Euston Road, originally 'The Wellcome Research Institution' later called the 'Wellcome Building', from 1932. Also Unicorn House - the Head Office of the Wellcome Foundation from 1990. * Frant - the Veterinary Research Station, it consisted of Ely Grange & manor House, with several farms. The most well-known farm was 'Tyburn Farm' where 'Code Name Operation Tyburn' (research into Scrub Typhus) took place during WW2. * Snow Hill - the Head Office site near Holborn Viaduct. Various offices were used from 1879 when Burroughs arrived in London, however the company settled in one set of offices until they were bombed in WW2. * Wandsworth - 'Bell Lane Wharf' the site of the first factory from 1883. OVERSEAS Both Wellcome and Coopers were international companies from very early in their histories with offices and sales agents across the globe. The circa dates given are from the establishment of subsidiary companies, though both companies had dealings in the countries from before these dates. So although Ireland and Spain only gained subsidiary companies late in Wellcome's history, these countries had been targeted from the 1880s. Some of the cities where the main offices were based are also indicated: * Africa - Egypt, Ghana, Kabete, Kenya (1955), Nairobi, Nigeria, South Africa (1902 - East London, Johannesburg), Tanzania (1974), Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe * America - Argentina (1910), Brazil (1955), Canada (c1906), Caribbean, Cuba, Mexico (1967), USA (1906 - New York; Greenville; Tuckahoe; Research Triangle Park), * Asia - Arabian Gulf (1977), Ceylon (1976), China , Hong Kong (1972), India (1912), Indonesia, Iran (1973), Japan (1971), Jordan, Korea, Kuwait, Malaysia (1968), Nepal, Pakistan (1956), Philippines (1968), Saudi Arabia, Shanghai (1908), Singapore (1968), Syria, Taiwan, Thailand (1972), * Australasia - Australia (1886 - Sydney), New Zealand (1954) * Europe - Austria (1972), Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Finland, Germany (1967), Greece, Holland (1967), Hungary, Ireland (1972 - Dublin), Italy (Milan 1905), Malta, Monaco (1964), Norway, Portugal (1973), Russia, Spain (1966), Sweden, Switzerland (1978), Turkey * In addition Wellcome's work on the Wellcome Research Laboratories (later the Wellcome Tropical Research Laboratories) at Gordon College, Khartoum in the Sudan are also well documented - particularly in Wellcome's correspondence (see WF/E/01). COOPERS Coopers had a strong connection with countries that had large sheep or cattle herds (hence little connection with Asia). Those with no dates in brackets were formed as companies pre 1960: * Africa - Kenya, Rhodesia, South Africa, Uganda (1971), Zambia (1969) * America - Argentina, Paraguay (1969), Peru (1965), Uruguay, USA, Venezuela (1965) * Australasia - Australia, New Zealand * Europe - Belgium, France, Italy, Ireland, Spain",0,,
Wellcome,jcxh54b9,b19677984,MS.207,,['Malaysia'],"Constantinus Africanus, <i>Viaticum</i>","A copy of Constantinus Africanus, Viaticum, with glossa by Geraldus Bituricensis, on parchment, written in Gothic hand in France in the late 13th century, with decorated puzzle initials. Contents 1. f. 1: Medical recipe, early 15th-century hand, faint. 2. ff. 2r-93r, Constantinus Africanus, Viaticum, in Latin, with Glosule by Geraldus Bituricensis. The medical summa traditionally called Viaticum or Breviarium, as in the present manuscript, is a Latin adaptation by Constantine the African (c. 1020-1098/9) of a standard medical manual in Arabic, entitled Kitab Zad al-musafir wa-qut al-hadir (i.e. Provision for the Traveller and the Nourishment of the Settled) composed by the Abu Ja'far Ahmad ibn Ibrahim ibn abi Khalid al-Jazzar (Ibn al-Jazzar) (d. 979 or 1004-5), the famous physician of Qeirwan (al-Qayrawan, Kairouan) in Tunisia, who had been a pupil of Ishaq ibn Sulayman al-Isra'ili (fl. c. 855-955), known in Europe as Isaac Judaeus. Most of Ibn al-Jazzar's work was lost, but the Kitab Zad al-musafir survived having been translated into Greek during his lifetime. Constantine's adaptation followed the 'a capite ad calcem' order of the original work and was written in the 1070s or 1080s at Montecassino, from where it was widely disseminated throughout Europe mainly by means of manuscripts copied in Benedictine scriptoria. Constantine's version was conceived as a concise textbook intended for Latin readers, and primarily for the medical school of Salerno. Therefore it remained close to the Arabic original in terms of structure and contents, but differed in length and identification of sources, favouring ancient Greek and Hellenistic references rather than Arabic sources. The Viaticum was taught at medical faculties during the 12th and 13th centuries and was particularly popular in France, as documented by a number of commentaries written within French medical circles up to the 14th century: see Mary Frances Wack, Lovesickness in the Middle Ages. The 'Viaticum' and Its Commentaries (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1990), pp. 31-35; Mirja Martha Brachtel, Ibn al-Jazzar's Zad al-Musafir and Constantinus Africanus' Latin Version Viaticum Peregrinantis: A Comparative Study (Master's thesis, International Islamic University, Malaysia, 2005) [available online at https://www.academia.edu/7595021/IBN_AL-JAZZ%C4%80RS_Z%C4%80D_AL-MUS%C4%80FIR_AND_CONSTANTINUS_AFRICANUS_LATIN_VERSION_VIATICUM_PEREGRINANTIS]. The present manuscript is a copy of the vulgate tradition of the Viaticum (the cataloguer is grateful to Dr Brian Long for the information). The Glosule represent the first surviving full commentary on the Viaticum by Gerardus (Geraldus, Girard) Bituricensis (of Berry), a French physician operating in Paris between the late 12th and early 13th century; he compiled his glossa probably drawing from direct teaching experience and at the request of his Parisian colleagues: see Ernst Wickersheimer, Dictionnaire biographique des médecins en France au moyen âge (Geneva: Droz, 1936), vol. 1, p. 203; Danielle Jacquart, Supplément (Geneva: Droz, 1979), pp. 92-3; Wack, Lovesickness in the Middle Ages, pp. 51-56. The texts are listed in eTK, A digital resource based on Lynn Thorndike and Pearl Kibre, A Catalogue of Incipits of Medieval Scientific Writings in Latin (Cambridge, MA: Mediaeval Academy, 1963; with supplements in 1965 and 1968; online at https://medievalacademy.site-ym.com/?page=Books#etk), nos 817D (main text), 1298H (prologue), and 325J (Gerardus's commentary). For other manuscript copies of Constantine's Latin text in the Wellcome Library, see MSS 208 (imperfect), 209, 547 (ff. 55r-103v; imperfect), 730 (f. 23r; extracts); for copies of Gerardus's commentary see MSS 305, 535 (ff. 61r-120v). Both Constantine's text and Gerardus's commentary were printed for the first time in 1505 in Venice, together with other works by Gerardus: In hoc volumine continentur, Introductorium iuuenum Gerardi de Solo.

Wellcome,kjykycnw,b15879392,,,['Malaysia'],Wild child.,"Documentary looking at feral children and the question of how to rehabilitate them. Oxana Malaya was left outside by her alcoholic parents as a toddler, so crawled into a kennel for warmth and spent more time with dogs than humans, so grew up behaving more like a dog than a child. Dramatic reconstruction illustrates the story of Victor, the first scientifically recorded case of a wild child, discovered in France in 1800. The experiments of Winthrop Kellogg and Harry Harlow, both involving the early development of monkeys, are briefly covered. The case of Jeannie Wiley is explained in detail: she was discovered as a 13-year-old in a house where she had been kept in total isolation by her parents, strapped to a potty chair by day and kept in a cage at night. She was unable to walk and was never spoken to, so was unable to speak. Child Psychologist James Kent and Professor of Linguistics Susan Curtiss talk of their work with Jeannie. In the Ukraine town of Mirny, a 4-year-old boy called Edik who grew up with stray dogs is now living with a foster family. James Law, Professor of Language and Communication, visits Edik to evaluate his prospects. Although, with help, rehabilitated feral children are gradually able to empathise and learn single words, they will not be able to learn spoken language and grammar past the age of 4 years. They will probably have social and emotional problems and difficulties in forming personal relationships. The programme ends by pointing out that we should be inspired by these children because in spite of the horrendous treatment they have had, they have a kernal of humanity that will not be crushed, and are still willing to put out a hand and touch a new person.",0,,

The two earlier books are informal records of income and expenditure with simple lists of incoming and outgoing payments (including household, family and private expenses) plus year-end analyses. These possibly represent a larger series of rough account books, from which the numbered series of ‘Cash books’ were prepared, which seems likely given that there is an overlap between GP/55/2 and GP/55/3, which both cover the year 1963. The numbered series of ‘Cash Books’ (beginning at no. 6) have Income and Expenditure laid out on facing pages and figures entered in orderly columns under different headings such as ‘Patients’ fees’ ‘Drugs, etc’.",1,,

This part features feral children - are they the natural experiment that allows us to confront the nature / nurture debate? The programme is focused around the story of 13-year-old Oxana Malaya who, at 3-years-old, was left to sleep with the family pet dogs as her parents were alcoholics. By the time she was 8 she was behaving more like a dog than a human - we see how she has progressed since then. Other stories include the harrowing tale of Jeannie Wiley in the 1970s who for 13 years was kept in silence in a dark room, strapped into a potty chair by day and left to sleep in a chicken wire cage by night. We also see archive footage of Kellogg's experiments with a monkey companion for his baby son and Harry Harlow's experiments on monkeys.

Wellcome,umrcr445,b19610609,SA/SMO/N.16-17,,['Malaysia'],Records of Overseas Branches,"Although the Society included members in almost all parts of the world, particularly the British colonies, their numbers and the wide distances between them often precluded the successful formation of overseas Branches and their long-term existence. This series contains records of the East African Branch and the New South Wales Branch only. Some information on the overseas branches, for which there are few records, may be found in the Council minutes, Section B, and Public Health, J.3. The Hong Kong Branch was set up in 1963. Contact lapsed in 1973 but was re-established in 1977. The 'Branch' became independent in 1978 while maintaining affiliation and their title became either The Hong Kong Society of Community Medicine or The Society of Medical Officers of Health, Hong Kong. (See B.1/19, meeting papers for Jul 1977 and Feb 1978). No records in this deposit. M Pelling's 'Handlist of Public Health Records', 1985, states that some records are in the possession of Dr S McClatchey. Efforts to locate them in 1998-1999 were unsuccessful. A Malayan Branch existed at least from 1925-1934. Public Health Vol 37 No 5, Feb 1924, p117, states that the Society of Medical Officers of Health for Malaya asked for some form of affiliation to the Society. This proposal was discussed in 1925. The Malayan Branch appears in the journal's Branch elections list for the sessions 1925/26 through to 1933/34. It is not known what happened to the Branch after this date. A Malayan Branch re-appears in the election lists for 1956/57. The editorial of Public Health Nov 1956, Vol 70 No 1, p21, states that a new Branch in Malaya was 'coming into being' and Vol 71 No 3, Jun 1957, p117, contains a report of the 'birth' of the Malayan Branch, Nov 1956. It is not known when this Branch ceased to exist. No records in this deposit. Southern Australia Branch: Public Health Nov 1900, Vol 13 No 2, p134 contains an extract from the Australian Medical Gazette reporting the recent formation of a Society of Medical Officers of Health in Adelaide, which would be known as the South Australian Branch of the Incorporated Society of Medical Officers of Health in England. This was the first overseas/colonial Branch of the Society. The first meeting was held in Sep 1900 at which the president, T Borthwick, gave an address on 'The outbreak of plague (so-called) in South Australia, from a personal standpoint'. The Branch was dissolved by the Council of the Society, at the request of members, in 1903. No records in this deposit. The South Indian Branch existed at least from 1925-1934. Public Health Dec 1923, Vol 37 No 3, p68, states that the Society had received an inquiry from Medical Officers of Health in the Province of Madras, India, regarding formation of a local Branch of the Society. The Executive Secretary was directed to consult members of the Society in India in reference to this proposal. The South Indian Branch appears in the journal's Branch elections lists 1925/26-1933/34.

He also did important work on Kala-azar, the differentiation of tropical fevers, snake-venoms, the treatment of tuberculosis, and the animal diseases of rinderpest and surra. He was instrumental in bringing about the foundation of the Calcutta School of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, and was a founder member of the British Empire Leprosy Relief Association. He also played a significant part as a propagandist for the Research Defence Society. He made important studies in epidemiology, in particular the relationship between climate and disease, with specific reference to India. He received numerous honours and distinctions. His publications were very many and diverse (see E/1). Considerable arrangement of the papers had already taken place and it was clear that after Rogers's retirement from service in India he had given much attention to the preservation of the record of his work, by the preparation of summary notes of the contents of his diaries and by the editing of his diaries to make them more legible and bring out the events of significance and by the arrangement of correspondence. Most of the correspondence and notes deposited by Rogers with the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine had been arranged into bundles by subject, with introductory notes and lists of contents (and in some cases attached indexes). Most letters also include a brief note added by Rogers giving the correspondent's name and the main subject. This arrangement has been retained but an index to correspondents has been prepared . Besides the subject groups of papers there is a small group of letters to and from individuals which seem to have been principally of personal interest to Rogers. Although Rogers's own arrangement of the papers has been retained as far as possible, since they were deposited originally over a period of time it has not been possible to be completely consistent in the allocation of materials to particular sections of the list; for example some of the items in A.55 complement material to be found in Section C.",1,,

Wellcome,p4zrhhvm,b20028660,SA/SMO,,,Society of Medical Officers of Health,"The collection includes: records of the Society's central organisation including council and committee minutes, annual reports and accounts, 1856-1997; lists of members, 1895-1958 and 1990-1997; files relating to early activities, 1866-1908; Society publications including the journal Public Health, 1891-1994; files of comments and evidence provided by the Society, 1950-1997; minutes and files of regional Branches and specialist Groups of the Society, 1875-1997; and records of the Society's Faculty of Community Health, 1988-1998. Also included are some non-Society records such as public health literature, 1902-1991, and files relating to the journal The Medical Officer, 1897-1973. Section L comprises over 200 files, covering the 1950s to 1990s, relating to comments and evidence produced by the Society, which illustrate the extent of its activities and importance as an advisory body and source of specialist knowledge. Accordingly, it also provides a wealth of information on various public health topics, which supplements that contained in the Society's journal Public Health. The collection includes Vols 3-89 of the journal, covering 1890-1975, and incomplete volumes up to 1994. As well as being a medium for the publication of scientific articles and discussion of contemporary issues, Public Health stands as an important record of the Society's proceedings, role and policies. As a research tool it is equal in importance to much of the primary material in the collection and often fills in gaps in the latter. Records representing some of the Society's early activities in the emerging public health field are listed in Section K. Records of the Society's Branches, Regions and Groups form a major part of the collection. Branches and Groups were entitled to conduct their business independently of the central body and therefore records were not kept at Society headquarters. Many had to be located and retrieved by the Secretary and the Oxford Unit from former secretaries or members, local health authorities and libraries in the 1970s. A number of records, particularly of Branches, have been permanently placed in local repositories. Although the majority of Branch and Group records are listed or accounted for in Sections N and P and Appendices 1-2, some gaps still remain. Efforts made in 1998-1999 to trace additional material were largely unsuccessful, and it is likely that some papers are held in unknown repositories and privately, or have simply been destroyed. What has survived varies greatly in content, quantity and quality. This can be attributed to the level of activity, efficiency of the Secretary and custodial history. Records mainly comprise minute books and files maintained by the local or group secretary and the Society Secretary. Some minute books include transcripts of papers read, correspondence, menu cards, photographs and other ephemera, giving a broader picture of activities, e.g. Northern and Yorkshire Branches (N.8 & 15) and the School Health Service and Services (Hygiene) Groups (P.9 & 10). Records of the Society's Faculty of Community Health, including minutes and publications, are listed under Section Q, but they suffer from a number of gaps. Section R comprises a rich collection of secondary sources which vividly document and illustrate public health measures, policies and issues chiefly in the first half of the 20th century.",0,,

They were placed under the medical charge of G.B. Bolton, M.R.C.S., who made extensive observations along with others at the time. After visiting the principal cities in Europe they returned to America to settle as farmers in North Carolina, adopting the name of Bunker and marrying two sisters who bore each of them many healthy children. In 1869 they made another tour through Europe and took advice from eminent surgeons of Britain and France on the feasibility of being separated, with no ultimate conclusion.

In Asia the Thailand/Cambodia border is the epicentre of the disease. Thousands of Thai prospectors seeking precious stones in the border area return home with the malaria parasite in their blood. Self-medication then gives rise to drug resistant malaria. Dr. Nicholas White (University of Oxford) forecast disaster for these countries unless incentives are provided for research into new treatments. The best hope, meanwhile, seems to lie in an ancient chinese plant remedy for cerebral malaria. The film also looks at Thailand's battle against AIDS, begun too late to stem the epidemic. Funding for malaria treatment has fallen off in favour of research into an AIDS vaccine - although malaria is by far the greater killer.",0,,

The water supplies of small Chinese towns were infected with laboratory-grown bacteria as an experiment and samples were taken from victims who were then murdered. Chinese men were also rounded up for use in germ warfare experiments, which included anthrax spores, bubonic plague and glanders. The Japanese also set up germ warfare centres in Manchuria, Thailand and Singapore. Throughout the 1940s they field-tested bombs containing anthrax spores and even collected plague-infected fleas which were packed into bombs and dropped over China. Britain experimented with anthrax in 1942 on the island of Gruinard. There is film of these experiments, in which sheep were used to test the spread and toxicity of the anthrax organism. However, germ 'bombs' were never put into mass production in Britain. Japanese efforts to produce a war-winning weapon were finally defeated by the US atom bomb; and after World War II germ warfare research became a serious business in the US. That country gave an undertaking that it would be for defence purposes only, but elsewhere in the world biological weapons research was directed towards aggressive as well as defensive ends, with Iraq causing current concern over its holdings and their potential use.",1,,

The programme begins with the tragic story of Gwen Araujo who was murdered by a group of young men, two of which were former lovers, when they discovered she was a male. Transsexuals Calpernia Addams and Andrea James who run a website for transsexual people discuss their sexuality. Max Beck, born a hermaphrodite (intersex), tells how he was raised a girl but later on while settled in a lesbian relationship decided to begin to live as a male. Professor Maria Patino was disqualified as an Olympic athlete when blood tests revealed her to be a 'man' despite her living her life since birth as female. We see Noah, a 10-year-old transsexual child and his family trying to come to terms with his sexuality. Louis Gooren in Amsterdam talks about latest research into brain scans of transsexuals. We also hear about transsexuality in different cultures - a young Indian man becomes a woman, and in Thailand so-called 'lady boys' talk about how their transsexuality has affected their lives. The programme ends by looking again at the aggression transsexuals are frequently confronted with. Lester Wright narrates the findings of his 1996 study to assess how much of homophobia might be an aggression stemming from the denial / self-deception of the homophobe towards their own ambiguous sexuality.",0,,

Wellcome,cjwc4vat,b1970155x,WF/M/PL,,"['Indonesia', 'Singapore', 'Thailand', 'Myanmar', 'Philippines']",Wellcome Foundation Product Literature,"This collection of Product Literature was maintained by the Marketing Department of the Wellcome Foundation Ltd. It appears to have been instigated after the demise of the 'Guard Book' - volumes containing examples of product literature c.1880-c.1950 (see WF/M/GB). However, there are some items in this 'later' series surviving from before 1950. It forms an extraordinarily complete set of pharmaceutical product literature for the late 20th century (c.1950-1990). The collection includes some high-profile products for key drugs, such as Daraprim (anti-malarial) or Zovirax (anti-viral), and popular over the counter remedies such as Actifed or Calpol. The majority of the series is from the original collection, and remains in its original order (A-Z by Product name). Some additional loose items of product literature were incorporated as part of the sorting process upon arrival at the Wellcome Library in 2002. For each product listed there are varying numbers of surviving literature. The 'Extent' shows the number of producible items (i.e. how many folders). Where less than 6 pieces of product literature survive these are given as sub-items. E.g. 1 Item (2 sub-items). If no subitems are indicated the researcher can assume there is a substantial amount of material surviving. The type of literature varies as to whether the product was a prescription or 'over the counter' product. Marketing and press packs survive for some products. Prescription drugs have technical information leaflets which were for use by the medical profession (usually accompanying the pills in their packaging). Some packaging also survives - these tend to be simple boxes with a standard corporate design and text. Over the counter products contain advertising material aimed at consumers. These are often visual, with images associated with a particular brand, logos, pamphlets, posters, 'educational' advertising aimed at individuals or parents. Packaging also survives and this tends to be more vibrant than the prescription drugs - with clearly specific brand designs. Products were marketed throughout the world, including: Europe - Croatia, England, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Norway, Portugal, Russia, Spain, Sweden, Yugoslavia; Asia - Burma, China, India, Indonesia, Lebanon, Pakistan, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand; Africa - Kenya, Nigeria; North America - Canada, USA, and South America - Argentina. Languages included: mainly in English, but also in Arabic, Chinese, Danish, Dutch/Flemish, Finnish, German, Italian, Japanese, Norwegian, Portuguese, Russian, Serbo-Croat, Spanish and Swedish. Sometimes included are small complimentary marketing items given to medical staff - such as post it notes, pens, note pads, magnets, window stickers, coasters, window/point of sale display boards, magic writing tablets and other small 'executive toys'. Although recorded in lists created prior to transfer to the Wellcome Library, the following material was not identified at the time of cataloguing and therefore is not present in the catalogue: WF/M/PL/152 - Hypoloid - General WF/M/PL/207 - Neokharsivan:Phenothiazine Compound Dispersible WF/M/PL/206 - Neokharsivan:Kharsulphan WF/M/PL/299 - Stypen (Russell Viper Venom)",1,,
Wellcome,tub6g485,b15855776,,,"['Singapore', 'Indonesia', 'Thailand', 'Vietnam', 'Philippines']",SARS the true story.,"Horizon tells the story of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic from the point of view of the World Health Organization (WHO) which had the task of containing this dangerous viral illness. The WHO was first alerted by Dr. Carlo Obani of Hanoi who was alarmed at the symptoms of one of his hospital patients. Dr. Obani was unaware that the virus was already spreading through the hospital and in a short time, 60 patients died from it. Dr. Obani also became fatally infected. There had been rumours of a fatal disease spreading through Guandong, China, but China issued no warning and took no action. By the time the urgency of the situation was recognised, the virus had already spread across the border to Hong Kong and from Hong Kong its route was open to the rest of the world. At WHO Headquarters, Geneva, the Global Awareness and Response Unit took the unusual step of implementing its war plan. As well as Hong King and Vietnam, Singapore and Canada were already experiencing cases of SARS. This was the name give to it by the WHO. They announced a worldwide alert and sent out guidelines to hospitals. Even as they were setting up these precautions, new cases were identified in Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand and Germany. It was an urgent matter to identify the virus so the world's top microbiologists were asked to co-operate with each other in the search. The index case - the first person to contract the illness - was identified, Dr. Jianlun Liu, a Chinese doctor, who had carried the virus to Hong Kong. Method of tranmission was established and a breakthrough occurred with the isolation of the virus from a patient. It proved to be a corona virus which normally causes nothing worse than the common cold in humans, but this one had changed; probably an animal virus, it was likely that it had jumped species in Guandong, China, where people live at close quarters with their livestock. The human immune system is unprepared for the onslaught of new virus and the results can be lethal. There is no antidote for SARS; patients can be supported but ultimately the strenght of their immune systems resovles the battle one way or another. Four weeks after the start of the outbreak the WHO had identified the virus and its likely origin. But the disease was still spreading and there was doubt as to whether the WHO was in control of the outbreak. As panic mounted, however, the WHO's tactics began to take effect. Countries co-ordinated their resistance; Singapore screened everyone entering and leaving the country; hospitals screened patients, doctors and visitors and in Toronto 10,000 people were asked to go into voluntary quarantine. A medical team in Canada cracked the virus's genetic code and the virus was found to be barely mutating (unlike the HIV virus). If it remains stable there is a chance of developing a vaccine - but not in the near future. China's outbreak proved to be far greater than the country had admitted, but even so, the worst is now know about SARS and its death rate is lower than in severe outbreaks of influenza. The task is now to contain it within China, with the aim of eradicating it. This programme was filmed in Hanoi, Guandong, Hong Kong, Geneva, Ontario and Toronto. Contributors include Dr. Mike Ryan (Global Awareness and Response Unit, WHO), Dr. Klaus Stohr (influenza specialist, WHO), Dr. Sheila Basrur (Medical Office of Health, Toronto), Dr. Mike Leahy (virologist).",0,,

A card index to the 'Foundation News' and 'Wellcome Journal', was created c.1980-89, covering the years 1951-1989. It has been reproduced below (the original is catalogued as WF/M/PB/01/01/43). However, the Index is of selected subjects only. If a possible news item does not appear in the index but the date is known (such as a retirement) a manual check of the publication would be worthwhile. Arranged alphabetically by subject, giving date of edition and page number for each reference (for the most part). The subjects include products, people working for or associated with the firm, locations in which the firm operated, and general subjects which the company was working on (for example 'immunology').

Wellcome,d2h2yh4z,b20028659,MSS.5827-5852 & 7127,,['Thailand'],Morrison and Hobson Families,"The papers are the product of a period of considerable spiritual, cultural and political change in China. They are a significant source for study of the development of Protestant missions in China (in particular the role of the medical mission and the introduction of Western medicine), and also provide evidence of the involvement of the missionaries with issues of British trade and diplomacy. MSS. 5827-5852: correspondence and papers, especially of the Revd Robert Morrison (1782-1834), missionary in China, 1807-1834; John Robert Morrison (1814-1843), Chinese interpreter, Colonial Secretary of the Hong Kong government; and Dr Benjamin Hobson (1816-1873), medical missionary in China, 1839-1859. The majority comprise personal and domestic correspondence of the Morrison and Hobson families and their friends, with less emphasis on official papers, although the collection includes letters on the Peacock expedition to Siam and Cochin China led by Edmund Roberts (1784-1836), United States merchant and diplomat, 1832 (MS.5830), and letters to Benjamin Hobson from leading missionaries. 1843-62 (MS.5839). Insight into missionary work in China can be gained in particular from the letters of the Revd. Robert Morrison. MS. 7127: 'Domestic Memoir of Mrs Morrison', by the Revd. Robert Morrison, addressed to his children Mary Rebecca and John Robert Morrison (1814-1843), 5-7 January 1824. Mary Morrison, Robert's first wife, died of cholera at Macao on 10 June 1821. This memoir was compiled by Robert Morrison during the voyage home from China aboard H.E.I.C.S. 'Waterloo'.",1,,

In 1801 Flinders had set out in the ship Investigator to circumnavigate Australia and produce a detailed survey of its coastline, especially the southern coast which was still unknown, for the British government. In June 1803 the survey was abandoned due to the poor condition of the ship. Flinders sailed for England on HMS Porpoise to get another vessel to continue the survey but was ship-wrecked on the Great Barrier Reef. He managed to navigate the ship's cutter back to Sydney and arrange the rescue of the marooned crew. He then attempted to return to England but had to stop at Mauritius for repairs in Dec 1803. At this time France and England were at war and Flinders was detained as a spy by the French Governor. Flinders wrote to Sir Joseph Banks who was able to influence the French government that he was a scientist and explorer, not a spy, and approve his release. However, the French governor, General De Caen refused to release him and he remained a prisoner for six and a half years.

However the medical team at Hasan Sadikin Hospital want to operate on Dede and the Indonesian government encourage a huge media circus and admit him to the hospital for an intensive 6-month period of surgery. The surgery is shown in some detail. Eventually Dr. Gaspari is invited to Indonesia to present his plan to help Dede without relying on surgery alone - the wart virus is so virulent it will grow back quickly despite surgery. In the end Dede undergoes a combination of surgery and chemotherapy. He returns home in the hope that one day he will be completely cured.",0,,

Wellcome,gtkgeqzk,b29175598,,,['Indonesia'],The lost tribes of humanity.,"Presented by Professor Alice Roberts, this programme explores how recent research and genetic techniques have given us insight into the four distinct groups of humans who lived on the planet at the same time as ourselves; examining the complexity of human evolution. Roberts starts with the Neanderthals, travelling to Gibraltar where Prof Clive Finlayson of the Gibraltar Museum has been studying a cave system which contains the final refuge of the Neanderthals. Finlayson explains how the stereotypes regarding Neanderthals have been proven wrong evidence shows they were not only very cultured, but even capable of abstract thought, an ability that was previously thought to be exclusive to Homo sapiens. Professor Chris Stringer of the Natural History Museum, who has spent the last 30 years investigating the similarities and differences between modern humans and Neanderthals, explains that the two groups shared much of the same behaviour. With master flint knapper John Lord, Stringer looks at the tools Neanderthals used, which were the result of an exchange of ideas between the two groups. These interactions between Neanderthals and modern humans also helped our ancestors learn how to deal with the colder temperatures outside Africa. Professor Svante Pääbo, a geneticist from the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, then recounts how the excavation of a small finger bone in a cave in Siberia led to his team discovering the genome of an entirely new human group, which they called the Denisovans. So did modern humans come in contact with the Denisovans? The discovery of modern human teeth in Daoxian in China enabled archaeologist Dr Maria Martinón-Torres of UCL and her colleagues at the Chinese Academy of Sciences to date the move out of Africa at around 100,000 years ago. This means that our ancestors would have been living in Asia and Europe at the same time as Denisovans and Neanderthals. Anthropologists Dr Laura Shackelford and Dr Fabrice Demeter then recount the discovery of the third extinct human group, Homo floresiensis, in the small island of Flores in Indonesia. This species were nicknamed hobbits due to their small size, the result of island dwarfism. But since so many human groups have been discovered, Professor Roberts asks the pressing question why did Homo sapiens survive, when all these other groups died out? Professor Stringer discusses the environmental factors that led to the extinction of Neanderthals, and Dr Janet Kelso of the Max Planck Institute explains how the lack of genetic diversity would have been a major factor as well. However, genetic research has allowed us to realise that present-day human beings actually share some DNA with these extinct groups, which Dr Kelso explains was the result of interbreeding. Her team were able to analyse DNA from people all over the world and concluded that those from within Africa generally lacked Neanderthal DNA, whereas people living outside of Africa often did have it as their ancestors had come in contact with Neanderthal groups. They even found traces of Denisovan DNA, particularly among Papua New Guineans, Aboriginal Australians, and Tibetans. Most recently, a fifth Hominin group was discovered by Professor Joshua Akey, a geneticist at the University of Washington. Very little is known about this group as no fossil evidence exists, and thus far they are known simply as an Archaic African group whose DNA can only be found in some parts of central Africa. Professor Roberts explains that all of these recent discoveries have forced us to completely reimagine our linear view of human evolution, and that genetics has made a huge difference to the study of our species.",0,,

Wellcome,efs6djnt,b17238821,,,['Indonesia'],"Darwin's dangerous idea. Part 3, Life and death.","The third in a very informative three-part series in which Andrew Marr looks in depth at all aspects of Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection. This part looks at how the way we inhabit the earth is leading to mass extinction and how we've struggled to understand and accept the full implications of Darwin's legacy. Marr looks back at how Darwin's theory of natural selection upset the Victorian people of his tme and led to his fears at publishing his research. However, in the Indonesian jungle, naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace was reaching similar conclusions to Darwin. He wrote to Darwin and Darwin was finally impelled to publish. Following this, Ernst Heckel founded the science of ecology; Wallace noted the way in which extinction could be induced by the interference of man rather than being a natural part of evolution. Darwin's final book was on worms and showed how vital the earthworm is to our lives. The effects of industrialisation led to huge concerns about our changing relationship with nature; William Morris, in particular, campaigned to save the beauty of the English countryside. But it wasn't until the arrival of moth enthusiast James W Tutt that Darwin's theory was connected to the effect of industrialisation on evolution. His discovery showed that in industrialised areas, the black version of the peppered moth survived and increased, while the paler variety became extinct. This provided proof that the behaviour of humankind on their environment could directly influence the path of evolution. Other ecological studies ensued, leading to Rachel Carson's publication of 'Silent Spring,' which looked into the dangers of pesticides; a book now regarded as the original battle cry for the modern environmental movement. James Lovelock expanded Darwinian theory to describe a global ecosystem based on biological feedback. He called this the Gaia hypothesis. This coupled with the first view of our planet taken from the surfaceof the earth, led to the beginnings of environmentalism.",1,,

Reid.","""We had heard much of a person said to be covered all over with hair, and who, it was insisted upon, more resembled an ape than a human being ; a description, however, which, I am glad to say, was by no means realized by his appearance. Having expressed a curiosity to see this individual, the King politely sent him over to our dwelling some days ago, and Dr. Wallich and I took down on the spot the following account of himself and his history. His name was Shwe-Maong, and he stated himself to be thirty years of age. He was a native of the district of Maiyong-gyi, a country of Lao, situated on the Saluen, or Martaban river, and three months' journey from Ava. The Saubwa, or chief of the country, presented him to the King as a curiosity when a child of five years of age, and he had remained in Ava ever since. His height was five feet three inches and a half, which is about the ordinary stature of the Burmese. His form was slender, if compared with the usually robust make of the Hindoo-Chinese races, and his constitution as rather delicate. In his complexion there was nothing remarkable, although upon the whole he was perhaps rather fairer than the ordinary run of Burmese. The colour of his eyes was a dark brown, not so intense as that of the ordinary Burman. The same thing may be said of the hair of the head, which was also a little finer in texture, and less copious. The whole forehead, the cheeks, the eyelids, the nose, including a portion of the inside, the chin—in short, the whole face, with the exception of the red portion of the lips, were covered with a fine hair. On the forehead and cheeks this was about eight inches long ; and on the nose and chin, about four inches. In colour, it was of a silvery grey ; its texture was silky, lank, and straight. … Our draftsman made very faithful sketches of the father and youngest child, to which I refer. After making the party presents, they took their leave of us, extremely grateful for our attention. Shwe-maong, we found, had been occasionally employed by the Court as a buffoon, having been taught to imitate the antics of a monkey. For these feats, however, the poor fellow does not seem to have been very liberally rewarded ; for, to subsist himself and family, he was obliged to betake himself to the trade of a basket-maker, in which he was now employed. He would have turned his monstrosity to better account in London.""--Crawfurd, op. cit., pp. 318-323",0,,

The prince was so compassionate that when asked for a wish-fulfilling gem belonging to his father the king, he took it and gave it away. He was exiled to Koṅ-po (Kongpo) in Tibet, near the Buchu geomantic temple, and by and by gave away his wife, his children and his eyes. After much hardship all these were restored to him. The story, in the form of a drama, is often performed in Tibet and in Southern Buddhist countries such as Burma and Sri Lanka In the centre of the painting is Padma Sambhava (Tibetan Pa-dma-'byuṅ-gnas, ""He who was born out of the Lotus""), generally called Guru Rinpoche (""precious teacher""), founder of the Nyingmapa school of Buddhism in Tibet",0,,

In many parts of the Far Eastern war zone scrub typhus was endemic with the result that jungle warfare against the Japanese in Burma and other areas produced a great increase in the incidence of the disease."" [p. 1] ""The request from the Army High Command for a sufficient quantity of vaccine to be prepared to carry out extensive trials in troops engaged in combat areas carrying a risk of scrub typhus meant that 1½ million doses of scrub typhus vaccine would be required. The preparation of this quantity of vaccine was outside the resources of the National Institute for Medical Reseach. As the result of inquiries by the Ministry of Supply among the leading pharmaceutical manufacturing firms in Great Britain, the Wellcome Foundation agreed to undertake the production.... It was decided to recruit a team of scientific workers from civilian and service personnel available in the country and to appoint a civilian scientific director responsible to the Wellcome Foundation for the direction of the scheme. ""The project was given the highest operational priority with the secret code name of 'Tyburn'."" [pp. 2-3] The project involved the construction of an extensive animal housing facility in Sussex.

The microfiche version, reference AMS/MF/188, will be produced instead. ** Letterbook consisting of copies of internal and external letters sent by the head office of Burroughs Wellcome & Co, Snow Hill, March - June 1903. Topics covered in this letterbook include the day-to-day running of the business, with detailed correspondence with the Burroughs Wellcome productions site in Dartford and also the branches in Sydney and Cape Town. Iinternal correspondence covers such administrative details as terms of employment and recruitment. There is also correspondence with Burroughs Wellcome's Travelling Salesmen, such letters include discussion on such topics as sales techniques, the opening of new markets, the threat from rival companies and BW&Co products over which complaints have arisen. This letterbook also contains material on the case of Burroughs Wellcome & Co v Thompson and Capper (referred in the letterbook to the 'Manchester case'). The case was brought about after BW&Co accused Thompson and Capper of manufacturing and selling their own pills as Tabloids, and so infringing on BW&C's trademarked term. The letters to Henry Wellcome himself - written to him whilst he was on holiday - are detailed and offer a good summary of the range of issues covered in the rest of the volume.

Please order the microfiche version quoting the reference AMS/MF/166 ** 504 pages [ 2 letters on 455 cancelled as too faint] A number of letters were acknowledged by HSW's secretary whilst HSW was on an extended visit to the USA and Mexico, closely followed by a visit to Europe. A number of the letters received during this period were from America - presumably people whom HSW met on his travels. Many of the replies to meetings were to proffer apologies for HSW's absence. Sudlow was given Power of Attorney in HSW's absence - see 372. The contact address for HSW during his travels was c/o Messr Fairchild Bros. & Foster, New York. A number of letters re the purchase of furniture are signed by 'C. Irish &Co.' 'Irish' is referred to in other correspondence by HSW [employed as general handyman for the business?].

How to end poverty in 15 years.,"Professor Hans Rosling presents this episode of the BBC’s ‘This World’ Series: ‘Don’t Panic: How to End Poverty in 15 years’. Presenting in front of a live studio audience Rosling discusses poverty around the world and global efforts to deal with this problem. The main premise of the show is examining the United Nations 2015 Millennium Goal 1.1 aiming to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030. After questioning the audience on their perceptions of poverty, Rosling explains the difference between ‘relative’ and ‘extreme poverty’ and uses projected graphs, diagrams and statistics to demonstrate his points on the history of poverty and the relative decline since 1800. Footage of a family from Malawi serves as a case study into people living in extreme poverty. A young family from Cambodia serve as another case study into a family who can enjoy some basic luxuries due to a growing economy.",0,,

Wellcome,tfew5r2q,b19971540,,,['Cambodia'],Four born every second.,"This programme chronicles four births taking place in relative levels of poverty across four countries; America, England, Sierra Leone and Cambodia. The documentary is part of a BBC series; ‘Why Poverty?’ and is a cross-media event, spanning 70 broadcasters in 180 countries. The main focus of the series is; why do one billion people globally live in poverty? The documentary opens by posing the question ‘Is it worse to be born poor or die poor?’ Following the pregnancies and births of four women, all of whom would be defined as poor within their respective countries, the documentary discusses the ‘birth right lottery’; depending on your country of birth, the opportunities available to you, whether you are going to thrive or struggle, depends on where you were born. The documentary follows Starr, a 37 year old married mother of four living in San Francisco, California. Although her baby Billy-Jean has a life expectancy of 78, the United States has one of the worst child mortality rates in the developed world. Starr is shown attending the San Francisco Prenatal Programme, set up by Martha Ryan 22 years previously. In its first year the programme had taken into its care 72 expectant mothers; this year that number had reached 517. Ryan believes that this is evidence of a growing gap between those who have and those who have not in American society. The program then moves to Sierra Leone where Hawa is expecting her fifth child. According to the documentary, nineteen of the twenty worst countries to be born into are situated in Africa; Sierra Leone is at the bottom of the table. According to statistics, in Sierra Leone the average life span is just 49 and the country suffers from a high child mortality rate. Visiting the Gondama Referral Centre, Dr Philip De Almada and Dr Claire Fotheringham tell of their aim to reduce the maternal mortality rate by 75%; from 1 in 8 to 1 in 25. Dr Fotheringham worked out that it cost as little as €1.7 per mother for their treatment and care. Dr Almada believes that the world is rich enough but it is a question of redistribution of that money. The documentary then travels to Cambodia where Nuang is seen with her two children. Her older son must collect empty bottles and cans for money as they have no other source of income. Nuang’s adopted daughter was abandoned at one month; she is now five, living in Cambodia means that she is more likely to suffer malnutrition than go to high school. Recently in Cambodia pregnant women are now offered free health care, unfortunately Nuang’s third baby; LyLy dies at just two months from unknown causes. Finally the film follows Lisa, 22, a single parent living on benefits in the final stages of her second pregnancy; her daughter Grace was born two years previously. Out of all three women Lisa is the only one that appears relatively happy with her life, saying that although people may have more than her, she is happy with what she has got. Of all four countries the UK has the longest life expectancy, many living to see their 100th birthday. The programme attempts to give a worldwide perspective on poverty, revealing the real losers in the birth right lottery. The film has rather shocking footage featuring scenes of still births and statistics about child mortality.",0,,

As a member of the League, he undertook various advisory international missions, where he provided recommendations and guidance to governments on public health matters, such as the control of cholera, typhus fever and small pox. His first mission as Secretary of the Malaria Commission of the League of Nations was in Greece, advising on a pandemic of dengue. Mackenzie made recommendations to the Greek government on how to control the epidemic and how to prevent a recurrence. In 1929, he returned to Greece to carry out a general survey of the country from a public health perspective, including the study of the incidence of infectious disease in all parts of Greece. Between 1929 and 1930, Mackenzie visited Bulgaria to conduct a survey on areas by syphilis. While in Bulgaria, he met government officials to discuss the current conditions and environment and produced a report based on his findings. In 1930, Mackenzie was sent by the League of Nations to Bolivia to make recommendations for the reorganisation of the country's health services. In order to do so, MDM conducted a survey over a nine month period, focusing on diseases in the tropics of the Amazon, including malaria and dysentery. Between 1931 and 1932, Mackenzie travelled to Liberia as Special Commissioner to the Council of the League of Nations. In 1936, acting as Director of the Epidemiological Bureau of the League of Nations, Mackenzie visited Singapore to manage outbreaks of plague and cholera. As part of the League of Nations Eastern Bureau, Mackenzie collated reports from nearby countries providing local details of the existence of epidemics such as cholera and plague. This information was then distributed by the League of Nations to ship captains, pilots and doctors in ports, in order to prevent the transmission of infectious diseases between countries. In 1938, the League of Nations responded to a request from the Chinese Government to collaborate in epidemiological work, particularly for the prevention of cholera, small pox, typhus and malaria in the region. Mackenzie visited the country between 1938 and 1939 to report and advise on outbreaks of diseases triggered by the Sino-Japanese war.

Firstly there is a group of letters B.1-B.23 from various individuals with whom ESS was associated and with whom he had a considerable amount of correspondence. It is not clear what criteria were employed in selecting out this group while other correspondents of importance have been left in the alphabetical sequence. This group has been arranged chronologically by the date of the earliest item. It should be noted that the William Sharpey material includes a number of Sharpey's own papers which were saved from destruction by ESS, as well as letters from Sharpey to ESS. The second group B.24-B.65 consists of correspondents arranged in alphabetical sequence. Although most correspondents in this series are represented by a mere one or two letters some corresponded with ESS over quite some period. For ease of handling and reference the series has been divided up into 65 files with the general reference PP/ESS/B. Each letter within each file has a number of its own. Letters from ESS's pupils Sanger BROWN and Sutherland SIMPSON are to be found under AMERICAN COLLEAGUES. Letters from a number of these correspondents are to be found in other sections of this collection.",0,,

Photograph, 19--.","A dragon chair on which a Chinese medium or shaman (tongji, or tang-ki in Hokkien) sits while in possession by a God such as Sun Wu Kung (Monkey ) or No cha or others. This is connected to the popular religion of the Chinese, not to formal religion, and it is the sort of thing that was looked down upon by upper class or educated Chinese. The custom is very much alive in Singapore and you can find film of tang-ki ceremonies on YOUtube: the chairs are often shown but the version with sword blades is only shown for a moment on one. Photographs of tangki show body piercing with long skewers, striking the body with a spiked ball, tongue cutting and slashing the body with swords -- all without permanent damage, and all to show the superhuman powers of the god in the medium. As well sword- or nail-chairs, mediums sometimes climb sword ladders. ... ""I can fully believe that the chair was sold to Sir Henry [Wellcome]'s agents as a torture chair, because this would fit in with the sadistic Chinese Fu Manchu stereotype of the period."" (information from David Jones, 2012) Chair in the Wellcome Historical Medical Museum, London. Bears display label, since removed, saying ""Torture chair. Chinese. XVIII century"".

Dorothea and Charles’ correspondence was fairly mixed (reflecting their working life together) with the exception of two distinct groups: correspondence about Dorothea’s research on alchemical manuscripts, and later correspondence about her hearing aids. The main part of the collection centres on the correspondence; this has been grouped together in a self-evident sequence: writings and biographical personal papers follow. Certain of Dorothea’s papers remained clearly distinct and these have been kept together. Section E contains a variety of material relating to Jewish refugees, which had been placed on one side by Dorothea after the war for permanent preservation. It has not been listed in detail but sorted into three broad categories. The last section, comprising additional correspondence of the Singers with Sir Zachary Cope, Sir Arthur Salusbury MacNalty and Dr F.N.L. Poynter, is not strictly part of the collection, but these groups of correspondence were given to the Institute to be placed alongside the Singer papers.",0,,

The description below applies to the entire original volume, which is now spread across two microfilms (AMS/MF/174 and AMS/MF/175). Please order both films to be sure of finding material listed below. ** Letterbook consisting of copies of internal and external letters sent by the head office of Burroughs Wellcome & Co (BW&Co), Snow Hill, December 1881 - May 1897. This was a joint business letter book - with letters by Wellcome, Burroughs and the key senior managers Kirby and Sudlow. There are significant overlaps with WF/E/01/01/01 from August 1882. The Letterbook includes letters illustrating the breakdown in the business relationship of Burroughs and Wellcome (eg referring to each other as ""Mr..."" in internal memos that are being sent to each other in the same building) and also letters on the aftermath of Burroughs's death. A great deal of the correspondence relates to trade and sales, whether it is the gift of BW&Co products to notable names and institutions (eg Cecil Rhodes; British Army) or the relationship with BW&Co sales agents across the world.

The description below applies to the entire original volume, which is now spread across two microfilms (AMS/MF/174 and AMS/MF/175). Please order both films to be sure of finding material listed below. ** Letterbook consisting of copies of internal and external letters sent by the head office of Burroughs Wellcome & Co (BW&Co), Snow Hill, December 1881 - May 1897. This was a joint business letter book - with letters by Wellcome, Burroughs and the key senior managers Kirby and Sudlow. There are significant overlaps with WF/E/01/01/01 from August 1882. The Letterbook includes letters illustrating the breakdown in the business relationship of Burroughs and Wellcome (eg referring to each other as ""Mr..."" in internal memos that are being sent to each other in the same building) and also letters on the aftermath of Burroughs's death. A great deal of the correspondence relates to trade and sales, whether it is the gift of BW&Co products to notable names and institutions (eg Cecil Rhodes; British Army) or the relationship with BW&Co sales agents across the world.

Please order the microfiche version quoting the reference AMS/MF/174 and AMS/MF/175. ** Letterbook consisting of copies of internal and external letters sent by the head office of Burroughs Wellcome & Co (BW&Co), Snow Hill, December 1881 - May 1897. This was a joint business letter book - with letters by Wellcome, Burroughs and the key senior managers Kirby and Sudlow. There are significant overlaps with WF/E/01/01/01 from August 1882. The Letterbook includes letters illustrating the breakdown in the business relationship of Burroughs and Wellcome (eg referring to each other as ""Mr..."" in internal memos that are being sent to each other in the same building) and also letters on the aftermath of Burroughs's death. A great deal of the correspondence relates to trade and sales, whether it is the gift of BW&Co products to notable names and institutions (eg Cecil Rhodes; British Army) or the relationship with BW&Co sales agents across the world.

Wellcome,h6gn4ves,b20016736,PP/CED,,,"Dent, Charles Enrique (1911-1976)","The vast majority of the material relates to Dent’s research and clinical interests and falls into four main categories: correspondence files; files created around the publication of papers; lecture notes and symposium papers; and case/research notes. There are also smaller quantities dealing with other aspects of his career, such as the administration of UCH Metabolic Ward. The papers thus reflect most of Dent’s scientific and clinical interests. This research is mainly represented by the abstracted documentation which he kept with drafts of his published papers (see section E.1) and also by correspondence about cases and clinical case notes (see section C.5). To a lesser degree they also illustrate the work at the laboratory bench which underpinned much of this research. For example, a file of unidentified paper chromatograms has been preserved (C.2/10) to illustrate one of Dent’s methods of working, as described by his colleague, Heathcote, and quoted in the Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society, 1978: ‘Paper chromatograms were not to be thrown away. They were filed and, since the colours faded, the outline of each spot was drawn in and the intensity of the colour was indicated by a number.’ The way in which Dent compiled a large series of files around drafts of scientific papers also illustrates the importance of the published paper to him as a stage in the research process. In order to help make sense of the collection, a list of publications is therefore provided as a note to this collection description. An incomplete collection of reprints of Dent’s published papers may be found in section E.2 of the collection.",0,,

Wellcome,bfnkej36,b17488618,,,['Philippines'],CBD : working from within.,"This film shows the new approaches to distribution and contraceptives being explored internationally by focusing on three studies of community-based distribution. Social marketing is seen at work in different settings in Sri Lanka, Philippines and Columbia. In Sri Lanka, condoms are rebranded with the name ""Joy"" to distance their association away from venereal disease. Distribution was via small local shops. Reckitt and Coleman handled the packaging. Shopkeepers are enlisted for education and information dissemination. A campaign to make the female contraceptive pill readily available was then rolled out. The film then looks at the situation in the Philippines. A family planning clinic was set up running alongside a church, Iglesia Cristo. Volunteers are shown preparing packs for distribution and then canvassing the clinic's facilities. The situation in Columbia is studied. A green flag is present outside distribution outlets for contraceptives. New adopters of contraception are called 'new acceptors'. The distributors and introducers split the proceeds from the sale of contraceptives.",0,,

Wellcome,hmudqw68,b32892329,MS.9316,,['Philippines'],"Spanish broadside mandating the smallpox vaccination for children, 23 May 1818","Description taken from seller's description: ""In 1803, the Spanish government began a campaign to vaccinate everyone in all its Spanish territories. The story of the Royal Philanthropic Vaccine Expedition (the so-called Balmis Expedition), is well known as one the first large-scale international public health initiatives. By 1806, many hundreds of thousands had been vaccinated, from the Viceroyalty of Peru to China and the Philippines. The epidemic resurged in Spain over the next decade, and fresh mandates were issued, including ours, in 1818, ordering all children three months of age or older to be vaccinated. The preamble to the mandate suggests that the lower classes are inherently less caring for their children and therefore bear more responsibility for the spread of the disease. The seven articles of the mandate are as follows: 1. All children of both sexes are to be vaccinated at three months of age. The parents or guardians of children whose constitutions are too weak to receive a vaccine must provide evidence to this effect from their doctors and submit it to the Board of Health. 2. Those who do not vaccinate their children or wards as per the first article are subject to fines. 3. Any child who contracts smallpox shall be quarantined in a room in their own home and cared for by someone who has been vaccinated or has already had the disease. If the child should die, the room will be chemically fumigated and sealed off. Those who contravene this article shall be fined. 4. Anyone twelve or older who contracts smallpox and cannot be cared for at home shall be transferred to a lazaretto (smallpox hospital) until they recover, and may not leave until a doctor permits it. When transfer to a lazaretto is not possible, Article 3 will be in force. When quarantine at home is not possible,quarantine at an available (general) hospital will be enforced. Those who contravene this article shall be fined. 5. Fines collected will be used to defray public health costs related to smallpox, to promote the vaccine, to pay for the cost incurred by members of the indigent population who contract smallpox,and to reward whistleblowers who reveal persons who are concealing the infected. 6. If doctors or those in the medical establishment conceal or do not report instances of the illness, they will be subject to higher fines. 7. The mandate does not supersede or abrogate laws already in place.The mandate (legally an edict) was signed by Francisco Javier Castaños Aragorri Urioste y Olavide, the 1st Duke of Bailén. Castaños, who later distinguished himself in the Napoleanic campaigns and then served as the first president of the House of Peers in Spain. Castaños is adamant in his goal of exterminating smallpox, and is clear that he will punish those who stand in the way: Cometo al zelo de las Juntas de Sanidad y Justicias el exacto cumplimiento de cuanto contienen los articulos que anteced enesperando que lo desplegaran ahora y en lo sucesivo, hasta conseguir eltotal exterminio de las viruelas, que por necesidad debe ser infalible, siel escarmiento reprime á los preocupados, y la persuasion convence a losque miran con indiferencia sus mismos hijos y el interes general de sus conciudadanos. Y para que llegue noticia y nadie pueda escusarse con la ignorancia , he mandado expedir el presente Edicto rmado de mimano y refrendado por el Secretario de S. M. y de esta Capitania General.

Wellcome,pyhqcacs,b31836392,PP/PCB,,,Patrick Clavell Blount,"The collection contains papers related to Patrick Clavell Blount's work as an anti-fluoridation campaigner, both as an individual and through his work as Chairman of the London Anti-Fluoridation Campaign (LAFC) and later the National Anti-Fluoridation Campaign (NAFC). The material mainly consists of correspondence with both pro and anti-fluoridation campaigns and commentators, MPs and Lords. It also includes LAFC and NAFC organisational papers including meeting minutes and financial records, circulars and other items produced by Blount for LAFC and NAFC members and subscribers, and speeches, notes and articles written by Blount as both an ideas and anti-fluoridation campaigner. There is also material produced by others which was collected by Blount in his research of the subject including newspaper cuttings, reprints, pamphlets, and leaflets. Sections are organised more specifically as follows: A: Organisational papers relating to the formation and management of the LAFC and NAFC, including select meeting agendas and minutes, financial reports and correspondence re. donations, and correspondence files relating to organisational and personal disputes on the overall running of the campaign. B: LAFC and NAFC material created and published by Blount, primarily for initial circulation to members and subscribers, including circulars, press releases, fact cards, memos and donation forms; a mixture of draft and final copies. C: Papers and correspondence with individuals and other organisations collated by Blount during the course of his campaigning as reference files, grouped in a number of ways by Blount including subject, type of organisation, name and alphabetically. D: Mainly articles, reprints, leaflets and pamphlets created by others on the topic of water fluoridation, both pro and against, published in the UK, USA, Australia and New Zealand, but also includes some material from other European countries, as well as material published by the LAFC and NAFC. E: Press cuttings collected by Blount on the topic of water fluoridation, both pro and against, grouped in a number of ways by Blount including alphabetically, by mentions of LAFC, NAFC and Blount in the press, by individual and by date. F: Correspondence, drafts and notes related to speeches, articles and other published writing from Blount as a campaigner for both anti-fluoridation and his ideas campaign. Also includes copies of his two books, ""Ideas into Action"" and ""Compulsory Mass Medication"". G: File containing obituaries and messages of condolence upon the death of Patrick Blount H: File containing correspondence and copies of newspaper articles collected by Patrick Blount's son following his death. J: File containing photographs taken of Patrick Blount. Books and journals produced by others which Blount collected have been catalogued separately;full list.",0,,
Wellcome,yef8epmt,b19578209,PP/ADD,,,Robina Addis (1900-1986): archives,"These papers reflect many different areas of Robina Addis's life and work, including her training and research; her involvement with both British and international societies and associations in the mental health field; visits abroad; lecturing, teaching and writing. After her official retirement she continued her involvement with the National Association for Mental Health, but was also able to extend her interests by working for the Save the Children Fund and other organisations, and these activities are also reflected in the collection. There are, however, many gaps in the papers. While RSA's early training and research are covered, her pre-War work in child guidance and during the Second World War are represented mainly by lecture notes and publications. Her long career in the NAMH is chronologically well covered from 1950 onwards, but the quantity of material is not great and it can be assumed that most of the papers were retained in the Association's internal filing system. With certain exceptions most of the papers representing RSA's other activities date only from the 1960s onwards and it is impossible to say what proportion of the total survives. The sequences of lecture notes and publications, do, however, seem to be fairly comprehensive.",1,,

The origins of British paediatric work were to be found in the political background: the United States of America requested some show of support (of its presence in Vietnam) by Britain. The then Prime Minister, Mr Wilson, sought advice from the Ministry of Overseas Development which suggested the scheme of supporting a childrens teaching hospital. Dr Evans was asked to visit Saigon as an adviser by the Ministry of Overseas Development (on the announcement of which he lost his appointment as Consultant Paediatrician to the Army).

This part features clinical scientist and doctor, Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust. For 18 years he ran the Oxford University Clinical Research Unit in Ho Chi Minh City studying and directing research in infectious diseases. He then became director of the Wellcome Trust and this is briefly introduced in terms of its size and impact, particularly internationally. Jeremy Farrar talks about his early life growing up in various countries around the world and how he became interested in clinical research during his time at university. Working as a doctor in the 1980s and experiencing treating people in the early days of HIV transmission had a profound impact on him and his decision to pursue a career in infectious diseases. He talks about his decision to go to Vietnam in 1996. Whilst he was there he was at the centre of dealing with SARS and H5N1 bird flu outbreaks which he elaborates. The first cases of H5N1 were diagnosed at the hospital in Ho Chi Minh City and Jeremy Farrar discusses how it felt to be there. He talks about how dealing with both diseases affected him, personally and professionally, and made him aware how local disease outbreaks affect us all globally. His time building up the research unit in Ho Chi Minh City is discussed, including what he hoped to achieve. There are contributions from two colleagues, HIV researcher Thuy Le in Ho Chi Minh City, and Nick White, professor of tropical medicine in Bangkok. Jeremy Farrar talks about the culture of research in Asia, and Vietnam in particular including how the politics there affect health research. The Wellcome Trust is then considered. He mentions the scope he has, as a new director, to reprioritise the direction of research should he wish to, particularly in support of international health in its broadest context. He talks about medical research funding areas generally and considers key areas of the Trust that are likely to be critical in the coming decades. These include, genomics and how this will work in areas of medical research, the brain and mental health, infectious diseases especially in relation to drug resistance, and sustainability of health and how we live, including the medical humanities. He talks too about climate change and how it is linked with societal changes. He thinks the Trust has been very forward thinking in working in the area of culture, society and the humanities in relation to science. Finally he talks about what he misses from Vietnam and in no longer being a doctor.",0,,

Behind the scenes, however, the Chinese government had already decided to throw in its lot with the Americans as against the Russians, who were perceived as the greater threat. After the two bloody border conflicts between the Soviet Union and China at Zhenbao (Damansky) Island in March and August 1969, there were reports that the Soviets were considering a pre-emptive nuclear strike against China: four marshals advising Mao Zedong emphasized the need for Beijing to prepare for a ""worst-case scenario"". President Nixon, after his election in 1969, declared his wish for America to have good relations with all countries, not excluding China. His remarks were taken up by Mao, leading to a secret visit to Beijing by Dr Henry Kissinger in July 1971 and an open one in October 1971, laying the foundations for President Nixon's visit in February 1972. In the negotiations with the United States Mao stressed the necessity of American withdrawal from Vietnam.

Section A, entitled 'Laboratory notes' is a compilation of Sir Harold Himsworth's experimental work on diabetes and liver function and disease. Series 1 and 2 comprise his experimental notebooks on experiments carried out on animal and human subjects. Some of the records in A/2 have therefore been restricted or closed to due the sensitive nature of the material regarding the human subjects. Series 3 entitled 'Research papers' is a mixture of experimental notes, calculations and notes which again has been restricted due to sensitive content. The final part of section A, 'Collected Articles' is a series of published academic articles written by Himsworth which cover both his experimental work and his role within the Medical Research Council. Section B relates to his role as Secretary of the Medical Research Council from 1949 to 1968. The bulk of this section is comprised of collected annual reports from this era along with specialist publications on the affect of nuclear weapons and another on CS gas that Himsworth was actively involved in producing. The rest of the series is comprised of memorandum, correspondences and related articles associated with his role as secretary of the MRC. Additionally, B/4 is a series of notes that Himsworth compiled whilst touring the African MRC stations in 1951. Section C covers all the collected papers regarding the Northern Ireland enquiry on the affect of CS gas launched after the public outcry of the use of the gas in Londonderry in 1968. This section contains correspondence that Himsworth received and sent debating the toxicity of the gas, with several letters and enquiries being received from the US and France relating to its use within the Vietnam conflict and the Paris Riots. There is a full series of official minutes from the committee and a large assortment of scientific articles relating to CS gas with a separate section relating to French research and reports. Section D entitled 'Social Science Research Council' is the collected papers, minutes and itineraries relating to the Social Science Research Council (SSRC) Warwick Conference, 1968. Amongst the reports there are several review papers on the state of anthropology, sociology and psychology research in Britain. Section F comprises of 'University College Hospital: War Time Reforms to Medical Education' with papers, reports, articles and correspondences related to Sir Harold Himsworth's interest and campaign to reform medical education during the first few years of the Second World War. The last section, G, is a general assortment of items that were personally collected by Sir Harold Himsworth. G/1 is split between medical history articles and miscellaneous scientific articles; G/2 are the collected obituaries that Himsworth collected over his lifetime; G/3 are draft and printed public addresses by Sir Harold and the final item is a copy of his philosophical publication Scientific Knowledge and Philosophical Thought .",1,,

The VIETNAMESE POT BELLIED PIG develops skin cancers, some 4cm across. These could be fatal in a human. However, frequently these tumours suddenly disappear. How does it happen? These pigs have some special immune system. FROGS, too, can heal themselves from serious abdominal wounds, even when in a squalid tank. Michael Zazlov, was astonished by his frogs, whose wounds did not fester, and has discovered they have chemicals at the wound site - an antibiotic he has called 'meganin'. He is trying to exploit this commercially. Do animals have special knowledge about medicinally useful plants. Manuel Arguillan investigated chimps eating the Aspinia plant with its hairy leaves rolled up. He found antibiotics which may affect nematodes. Richard Rangam disagrees and thinks the hairy leaf traps nematodes in the gut, so it is a physical effect, not chemical. George Lazano is totally sceptical as there are no controlled experiments. Andrew Wighton studies gorillas eating the Venonia plant. It is possible that generations of a successful species have selected some plants prophylactically.",0,,

Wellcome,pq84mnvm,b20927885,,,['East Timor'],The burning desire.,"In the second of two programmes, Peter Taylor considers the development of electronic or e-cigarettes, which are claimed to be far safer than conventional cigarettes. The tobacco industry is pouring vast amounts of money into the devices, which could make smoking socially acceptable again. Yet some view e-cigarettes as a smokescreen, deflecting negative press from the industry’s core business of selling tobacco. An estimated 2 million ‘vapers’ currently use e-cigarettes in the UK. British American Tobacco (BAT) was the first to launch the products in the UK. The company spends 160 million annually on developing new, safer products. According to BAT’s Scientific Director David O’Reilly, the nicotine contained in e-cigarettes is no more harmful than a cup of coffee – a claim refuted by leading paediatrician Sir Cyril Chantler, who cites the drug’s addictive properties. The rise of e-cigarettes has outpaced regulation, prompting a return to previously banned marketing outlets including sports sponsorship, television commercials and product placement in music videos. Mike Daube from the Australian Council on Smoking on Health is in no doubt; e-cigarettes are ‘a weapon of mass distraction’ and marketing dream for tobacco companies. The UK’s largest brand, E-Lites, sponsor Worcester Warriors rugby club. Taylor challenges the company’s Chief Executive, Adrian Everett, accusing him of normalising smoking. Yet e-cigarettes have helped many smokers to quit. In a deprived area of Derbyshire, where smoking rates are double the national average, GP Dr John Ashcroft has set up his own shop to sell the products. As yet, there is no direct evidence that e-cigarettes are a gateway to smoking for young people. But the anti-tobacco lobby are finding it hard to trust an industry that has lied and disassembled for so many years. Meanwhile in the developing world where 80% of smokers live, marketing restrictions are limited or non-existent. Taylor travels to East Timor, the country with the highest smoking rate for men in the world. Jorge Luna of the World Health Organisation says that smoking rates amongst young people are rising year on year. Taylor interviews the country’s Prime Minister Xanana Gusmão, who has no plans to introduce legislation, despite his Australian wife’s role as an anti-tobacco campaigner for UNESCO. In East Timor’s schools, children as young as 10 smoke openly. Taylor considers the history of cigarette adverting. The world’s biggest tobacco company Phillip Morris has recently launched a controversial new campaign, ‘Be Marlborough’, aimed unashamedly at young people. The campaign was launched in Germany, where cigarette advertising is still permitted in cinemas. An internet campaign swiftly followed. Although Marlborough claims its models are over 30, their clothing and poses resemble those of teenagers. The campaign was subsequently banned by a German court, but has since been rolled out worldwide. Taylor journeys to Argentina, which has the highest rates of smoking in South America. While the country has signed up to the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, it has never been ratified. The industry is quick to exploit loopholes in legislation, expanding point of sale displays to permit extensive advertising. Although smoking is not permitted in public places, the law is not enforced. Argentina is the second largest tobacco producer in South America, which may explain the industry’s relative freedom. In neighbouring Uruguay, the climate is rather more hostile. The country has the most stringent anti-smoking legislation on the continent, prompting Phillip Morris to sue for an estimated 2 billion dollars on IP grounds over health warnings on cigarette packaging. Former President and oncologist Tabaré Vázquez, who introduced the ruling, describes smoking as the worst pandemic that mankind has endured. Australia is fighting a similar legal battle, and BAT is primed to sue should plain packaging be introduced in the UK. The programme concludes with footage from Taylor’s previous documentaries on the topic, dating back 40 years.",0,,

Tate,,,,T00655,['Malaysia'],Spatial Form,"Anthea Alley gained recognition as a painter in the 1950s, making brutalist abstract paintings, often using everyday materials such as hessian sacks.

Tate,,,,T00396,['Myanmar'],Painting Brown and Black,"The painting is in oil on commercially primed canvas, and is unvarnished. The image is an abstract one, with almost figurative forms painted using brushy gestural strokes. There is no evidence that the composition was planned or drawn out before painting. Gaps of buff underlying paint have been left visible between adjacent blocks of colour such that these spaces provide delineation and outlines around the abstracted forms. The painting is well-bound and the artist does not appear to have diluted his paints significantly. The paint is fairly smooth and flat with little impasto except for slightly more loaded brush strokes created using a stiff bush and paste-like paint. There is some wet-in-wet work for example in areas where final touches of white paint have been painted over slightly wet brown and black paint, to create a layered partially blended effect. There is also evidence for paint applied over fully dried underlying passages, suggesting the painting was created over a period of time rather than in one sitting. The palette is dominated by brown (iron oxide) and black (bone black pigment), but streaks of bright red (cadmium red), pink and white provide contrast and interest. Castor wax was found as an additive in the oil paints which is a common tube paint additive used as a rheology modifier (to adjust the flow behaviour of paint, e.g. its viscosity) in modern oil paint formulations. Zinc soaps were found in the brown paint, which may also be present as a paint additive, used to give the paint a buttery consistency. Calcium carbonate (chalk) and barium sulphate have been found in the paints. These are common extender pigments used to bulk out manufactured tube paints. The painting is in excellent condition. Some small areas of cadmium red paints are water sensitive. Water sensitivity is commonly encountered in unvarnished oil paintings of the twentieth century and is an area of concurrent research (see the Cleaning Modern Oil Paints project). The painting is currently framed and unglazed.

Heath emphasised the physical qualities of the work by building it up with blocks of thickly applied paint.

They were used like counters in a game to mark the state of development of a particular composition and they helped me to think in terms of area. I always liked the juxtaposition of “ready-made” surfaces with painted ones but I usually resorted to paint as being more permanent when colour was involved. “White Composition” was one of my first works to show an interest in curved forms.’ Published in The Tate Gallery Report 1970–1972, London 1972.",1,,

This work is in an edition of three examples, all unpainted. There were no drawings for it (or for ‘Intervals I’). Kim Lim had the materials for both sculptures unused in her studio for about a year before formulating the works. The initial inspiration for her sculptures comes usually (as on this occasion) from her response to materials she has around her. She then works, from the start, in the scale she intends to use. For the Tate's works she made full-size maquettes in the same material she intended for the final sculptures. Not being machine-cut, these maquettes were destroyed after the finished works had been cut to specifications, jointed and glued (by a woodwork firm). Like ‘Intervals I’, ‘Intervals II’ was surface treated with polyurethane sealer and sandpapered down to avoid a ‘varnished’ look. None of the elements in either work has a ‘top’, ‘bottom’, ‘back’ or ‘front’. Unlike ‘Intervals I’, ‘Intervals II’ cannot be displayed flat against a wall. It may be displayed in any one of three arrangements, viz:- Intervals IIA, in which the two elements are placed side by side, separated by a gap of between 1 3/4 and 4 inches (at the installer's discretion), with prongs facing ‘outwards’ in opposite directions, the central spines almost vertical, the bottom edges on the floor and the top edges leaning against the wall. As in the leaning version of ‘Intervals I’, the bottom edges (which should be aligned) should be between 2 and 9 inches away from the wall, at the installer's discretion. Intervals IIB, which is the same as ‘Intervals IIA’ except that the two sets of prongs point ‘inwards’ towards one another. However, unlike ‘Intervals IIA’, ‘Intervals IIB’ may also be displayed flat on the floor (at no point touching a wall). Intervals IIC, in which the spines of the two elements are placed so as to touch the floor continuously and be parallel with one another, and the two elements intersect, supporting one another at a diagonal angle, with each prong touching a prong of the other element (not at their tips), no further means of support being required. In this position, the work should not at any point touch a wall In addition to being displayed at the owner's discretion in any of these ways, each of the three examples of ‘Intervals II’ can also be displayed in a fourth arrangement unique to it. Of these alternative arrangements, two do not belong to the Tate. In the first of these the spines of the two elements are placed parallel to one another, touching the floor continuously, close to one another but not touching, and the prongs point vertically upwards. In the second non-Tate arrangement, (‘Intervals IIE’) the elements are placed flat on the floor, spines parallel, with the two sets of prongs pointing ‘inwards’, each prong abutting one prong of the other element, and also touching the other element's spine. The arrangement of ‘Intervals II’ that is unique to the Tate integrates it with ‘Intervals I’ and is called ‘Intervals I plus II’. In this work the three elements are leaned against the wall aligned and at the same discretionary distances (one from another and all from the wall) as in ‘Intervals IIA’ and ‘Intervals IIB’. The central element is ‘Intervals I’ and the prongs of the two elements of ‘Intervals II’ (which it separates) point ‘inwards’. In notes written for the Tate Gallery in March 1977, Kim Lim explained how these works manifest her interest in ‘that space between wall and floor-the tension set up by the vertical, horizontal and the angle’. This interest first appeared openly in her sculpture in untitled works of 1970 and 1971. One of these consists of two boards each some 6 feet high by 9 inches wide which are leaned, aligned, against the wall with a small gap between them; in front of them a disc with a hollow centre lies horizontal, almost on the floor but crucially not quite touching it as it is supported on low blocks, thus appearing to float. This work is in wood painted pale pink. The other work, which is painted dark blue and leans against the wall, is a wider board out of which square sections have been cut at regular intervals down its length. In such a work ‘rhythms are set up in the piece itself, and forms caused by light falling on the piece repeat the rhythms like an echo. In works such as Intervals I and II and even more so in “Link” [acrylic tube and painted wood, 1975], light becomes an important element in the structure of the piece-making the work more “physical”, “comprehensible”. The works that follow the Intervals Series are pieces using mainly wood, and are a continuation of the same preoccupation with space, rhythms and light-I avoid “development” because it seems to imply a progression that starts at one end in a linear way-whereas my pattern of working seems more cyclic-certain forms and ideas reappear sometimes quite a few years later.’ Images very close to those of ‘Intervals I’ and ‘Intervals II’ are used in four prints by Kim Lim made in the previous year, ‘Ladder Series’ 1972, Nos. 1, 2,3 and 4. She writes ‘the two activities-making sculpture and print making-are of equal importance to me. The difference being that sculpture, for me, is a rather slow process while working on a plate or wood block can produce quick feedback-so that ideas I am involved in during a period sometimes appear first in the prints.’ Published in: The Tate Gallery 1974-6: Illustrated Catalogue of Acquisitions, London 1978",1,,

Tate,,,,T15938,['Singapore'],Sphinx,"Sphinx 1959 is a sculpture made of three found wooden blocks, assembled so that they sit atop each other. The element at the base is the narrowest of the three. The central element is elongated and has two circular metal rings inserted into it. The element at the top is positioned off-centre and, on one of its flat surfaces, it has a deep groove carved out vertically. Cracks along the grain of the wood suggest its history and uneven drying process. Sphinx was made the year before Kim Lim completed her studies at the Slade School of Fine Art, London. Since being a student at St. Martin’s School of Art and then at the Slade, Lim enjoyed the direct engagement with the material involved in the process of carving wood, working from a given shape and taking away. While still a student, Lim began to salvage, carve and assemble wood off-cuts found in wood yards. Assemblage allowed Lim to create from building blocks, with given forms and histories, and insert them into playful configurations that are harmonious yet seemingly off-balance. Lim did not paint the wood, as she wanted to maintain the original vitality of her materials. Instead, she scorched the surface so that various sections would acquire distinctive textures and reflect the light differently. ‘There was a kind of innocence and an arrogance at the same time,’ Lim later said of her early sculptures of the late 1950s and early 1960s (Kim Lim, interviewed by Cathy Courtney, Artists’ Lives, National Life Stories, British Library, C466/51, 1995, track 8, tape 5, side A, p.103 of the transcript). Like her prints from the same period, such as Shogun 1960 (Tate P07176), these formative sculptures have a distinct sense of wholeness and balance, combined with a certain boldness and rawness. The title Sphinx speaks of the artist’s love of ancient artefacts and evokes the still elegance and eroded surface of the Sphinx of Gaza in Egypt. Lim stated: ‘I found that I always responded to things that were done in earlier civilisations that seemed to have less elaboration and more strength’ (Kim Lim, undated notes from the artist’s personal archive). The tension between simple, clear and at times archaic forms and abstraction remained recurring threads throughout her career. The choice of title might also hinge on the enduring fascination among artists and writers for the hybrid quality of the mythical creature, used as a reference by other artists who experienced displacement, exile and diaspora, as in the case of Hilde Goldschmidt’s The Sphinx 1948 (Tate T03350). Over the years, Sphinx has been displayed in slightly different configurations, but the artist’s estate has confirmed that the correct, original configuration is with the top, ovoid element resting on the thicker part of the middle element rather than on the sloping part.

Tate,,,,T15938,['Singapore'],Sphinx,"The title of this work speaks of Kim Lim’s love of ancient artefacts. It evokes a mythical hybrid creature, with the head of a human and the body of a lion. While still a student, Lim began to salvage, carve and assemble off-cuts she found in wood yards. This allowed her to create art from building blocks which already had forms and histories. She then combined them into bold and playful configurations. Here, Lim scorched the surface of the wood so different sections would have distinctive textures and reflect the light differently",1,,
Tate,,,,T15939,['Singapore'],Borneo 2 (Steel),"Borneo 2 (Steel) 1964 is a vertically orientated painted steel sculpture that stands on an integral, flat square base. Totemic in nature, it is 1.6 metres tall and comprises the base, a post and, at the top, four non-orthogonal elements. Of these, one develops horizontally and the other three vertically, visually continuing the vertical development of the post and suggesting a degree of feathery lightness. As its subtitle suggests, the work exists in two different versions: a red version made in painted wood, Borneo 2 (Wood) 1964, and this metal version made in spray-painted green steel. Borneo 2 (Steel) was realised after the wooden version and presents a very high, smooth finish. In the 1960s Lim worked with a number of different materials, for a period electing to use painted steel. She drew from a range of cultural and visual traditions while developing an increasingly simple visual language. Borneo 2 (Steel) emphasises structure on a flat plane. The top part appears weightless, a life-size version of a two-dimensional cut-out; while the vertical, square-based ‘column’ suggests volume and strength. Prior to this, as a student in London at St. Martin’s School of Art and then at the Slade School of Fine Art, Lim had made sculptures in wood, enjoying the direct engagement with the material involved in the process of carving, working from a given shape and taking away. She began to salvage, carve and assemble wood off-cuts found in wood yards. In early sculptures such as Sphinx 1959 (Tate T15938), assemblage allowed her to create works from building blocks, with given forms and histories, and insert them into playful configurations that are harmonious yet seemingly off-balance. Lim did not paint the wood, as she wanted to maintain the original vitality of her materials. Instead, she scorched the surface so that various sections would acquire distinctive textures and reflect the light differently. While Kim Lim’s subsequent work remained consistently abstract, the totemic structure and title of Borneo 2 (Steel), together with the formal qualities of its bird-like top part, suggest the possibility of figurative and allegorical readings. It might in part be an homage to the sculptural birds of Constantin Brancusi (1876–1957), an artist Lim admired deeply. It might, given the title, also reference the birdlife of the Southeast Asian island of Borneo. Compared to other artists in Britain who in the early 1960s began working with steel, such as Anthony Caro (1924–2013), Lim opted for more poetic and personal references. Lim was born in Singapore and grew up primarily in the Malaysian peninsula. However, her paternal grandparents had migrated from south China to Sarawak, the Malaysian state on the north coast of Borneo. Hence, the work can be seen as referencing her family history of migration and relocation and her mixed cultural heritage.

Tate,,,,T12201,['Philippines'],Cloud Canyons No. 3: An Ensemble of Bubble Machines (Auto Creative Sculptures),"This work is a kinetic sculpture consisting of wooden boxes arranged in a circle on the gallery floor with a tall plastic tube placed at their centre. At the bottom of the tube is a quantity of soapy liquid that is turned into foam by compressors located inside the wooden portions of the sculpture. This results in the foam being projected upwards and out of the tube, forming a jet of bubbles that extends above head-height. The plastic of the tube is clear, such that once the bubbles are released they can be seen rising up inside the tube. The bubbles are produced constantly and form cloud-like clusters at the top of the tube, and once these clusters have been propelled upwards they drop back and slide slowly down the exterior of the tube to its base, where they rejoin the bath of soapy liquid from which they came. Cloud Canyons No. 3: An Ensemble of Bubble Machines (Auto Creative Sculptures) was made by the Filipino artist David Medalla in 1961. It is among the earliest of several ‘bubble machines’ that Medalla produced at the time and first exhibited in 1964 at Signals Gallery in London, a space devoted to international kinetic art that Medalla co-founded that same year. Cloud Canyons No. 3 bears the additional date of 2004, as it was recreated that year for the exhibition Art & The 60s: This Was Tomorrow at Tate Britain in London. Although the materials and construction for Cloud Canyons No. 3 are controlled by Medalla each time it is installed, the sculpture changes constantly once it is on display due to the varying shapes formed by the foam. In an interview in 1979, Medalla noted that he had been attempting with his sculptures to give ‘tangible form to invisible forces ... to find a model which would show the transformation of matter into energy’ (quoted in Araeen 1997, p.11), and the words ‘cloud’ and ‘canyon’ in the work’s title reflect the artist’s interest in the random shapes formed by the earth’s natural processes. The art critic Guy Brett has described the first installation of Cloud Canyons No. 3 in 1964 as follows: The foam was allowed to follow its own aleatory paths, emerging and forming according to its own energies interacting with gravity, air currents, atmospheric pressure, and the shape of the containers ... the analogy with clouds was no exaggeration. It was never the same two days in a row.(Brett 1995, p.53.) In creating his series of Cloud Canyons, Medalla drew on a range of artistic practices as well as scientific theories that were emerging at the time. He was inspired by the ‘auto-destructive’ sculptures of the Polish artist Gustav Metzger, a friend of Medalla who was also involved with Signals Gallery, and by current research into relativity and cellular biology. Medalla has explained that his use of bubbles was also connected to specific childhood memories, including the clouds in tropical sunsets in Manila; watching his mother cooking; a visit to a brewery in Edinburgh; and the frothing mouth of a wounded Japanese soldier he discovered in the family garden. Although his work was inspired by personal experience, Medalla was concerned with breaking the boundary between the spectator and the artwork and intended for viewers to bring their own personal interpretations to the cloud-like forms created by the bubble machines. He said in 1968: The most important thing is to give life to materials, so that instead of finding ourselves separate from them, we find a complete dialogue with the material.(Quoted in Brett 1995, p.62.) Photographs of the bubbles created by Medalla’s work were reproduced in the Signals Gallery Newsbulletin in September 1964. In the accompanying text, Metzger called Medalla ‘the first master of auto-creative art’, implying that Medalla’s practice was a variation on Metzger’s own auto-destructive art. Metzger argued that the bubble machines were ‘capable of achieving not only the most complex forms and motions but also an aesthetic content of the highest order’, and that they were extensions of the work of earlier modernist sculptors such as Constantin Brancusi, Hans Arp, Alexander Calder and Naum Gabo. In 1968, Signals member Paul Keeler showed a copy of the September 1964 Newsbulletin to the artist Marcel Duchamp, who subsequently created an edition of one hundred sculptures entitled Medallic Object that took the form of a medal bursting with bubble-shaped forms.

Tate,,,,T12201,['Philippines'],Cloud Canyons No. 3: An Ensemble of Bubble Machines (Auto Creative Sculptures),"Medalla has described himself as ‘a poet who celebrates physics’, combining science and nature with art. He has made a number of cloud machines which are meant as a kind of living system; the machine produces a steady flow of tiny bubbles that refract light into rainbows. In such works Medalla employs technology to produce forms that are organic, sensual, shifting and playful. The streams of bubbles evoke cells yet also embody the ephemeral, hovering between a material presence and an immaterial nothingness.",1,,
Tate,,,,T15371,['Philippines'],Sand Machine Bahag - Hari Trance #1,"Sand Machine Bahag – Hari Trance #1 is a kinetic sculpture originally conceived by David Medalla in 1963 and refabricated under his authority in 2015. Presented on a white plinth, the artwork takes the form of a shallow metal tray of sand, from the centre of which a small section of silver birch tree protrudes vertically. Atop this is a square pane of glass, from the corners of which are suspended two lengths of bamboo cane. The ends of the bamboo are connected by a length of copper wire threaded with brightly coloured, ornate glass beads. A rotating mechanism concealed in the length of birch creates a slowly turning motion by which the beads create a circular ‘calligraphic’ impression in the sand; a trace which is continuously renewed in each thirty-second rotation. The apparent precariousness of the work’s construction is in keeping with the artist’s ongoing questioning of the generalisation that sculpture must be monumental, static and timeless. The use of organic matter, prevalent across much of Medalla’s work, distinguishes his practice from that of his artistic contemporaries Takis (born 1925) and Jean Tinguely (1925–1991), whose kinetic sculptures were constructed primarily from synthetic and non-organic materials including metal and magnets. Guy Brett – who exhibited Medalla and Takis at his short-lived yet ground-breaking gallery Signals London (1964–6) – coined the term ‘biokinetics’ to describe Medalla’s practice, which draws upon the scientific disciplines of biology and physics, which the artist then additionally inflects with cosmic or fantastical elements through his titles and descriptions. Medalla has made a number of ‘sand machines’, works which are most closely associated with the Signals period of his career. He has described them specifically as ‘a metaphor for the future, when technology will be able to use solar power to help irrigate the world’s deserts’ (David Medalla, quoted in Brett 1995, p.56). Sand Machine Bahag – Hari Trance #1 is thematically aligned with other related works by the artist, being informed by his experiences of migration as he has explained: the initial inspiration for my first sand machine came from my memories of the rice terraces of the mountain provinces of the Philippines, where I spent one year of my boyhood as a student at St. Mary’s School in Sagada. I also witnessed a sandstorm in the Sahara desert on my way to Europe in the spring of 1960 … The other sand machines I made, for the exhibition ‘Force Fields’ curated by Guy Brett at MACBA in Barcelona, and at the Hayward Gallery in London in 1999, were of a more festive nature and reminded me of the happy times I spent on the beaches in the Philippine Islands, like the island of Cebu where my mother came from. (Quoted in Nankervis 2011, accessed 1 August 2018.) The title combines both English and Filipino words – whilst the ‘sand machine’ aspect is mainly descriptive, the word ‘bahaghari’ is broken up by a hyphen. ‘Bahag’ alone refers to the bahag loincloth, a form of indigenous, pre-colonial Filipino dress. When the title is read aloud in its entirety, however, the word bahaghari translates as ‘rainbow’, conjuring up ideas of hope and optimism, specifically in its universal symbolism for LGBT movements across the world. This poetic description exemplifies Medalla’s expanded perception of time and space – abstract concepts that he conflates in his art to create a sense of shared humanity. These characteristics are also central to his series of ‘bubble machines’, such as Cloud Canyons No. 3: An Ensemble of Bubble Machines (Auto Creative Sculptures) 1961, remade 2004 (Tate T12201).

Tate,,,,T12020,['Indonesia'],Saint Sebastian,"Saint Sebastian is a two-channel colour video installation comprising footage of young Japanese women participating in an archery competition. The footage is shown on a white, double-sided projection screen that measures 253 x 450 cm and is hung in the middle of the gallery space. The two films are projected onto either side of the screen and play simultaneously. One video comprises close-up shots that present the archers from behind and from either side. Some of these shots show the women lining up and firing their arrows, while others zoom in to focus on details of their bodies and dress, including their ears, necks and the colourful pins and flowers that decorate their hair. In this film, the archers’ silent concentration contrasts with the sound of a crowd of spectators that is played through speakers that are placed near to the screen. The video projected onto the other side of the screen shows close-up and usually partial shots of the women’s faces as they stretch their bows, fire their arrows and prepare to shoot again. In this video the close-range filming of the women’s faces means that viewers cannot see the archers’ targets, so that it remains unclear whether or not the shots are successful. The women generally do not show strong facial expressions but they frequently look down while readying their bows, and this often gives them a melancholic appearance. This impression is accentuated by the atmospheric electronic music that plays on this side of the screen. The Australian artist Fiona Tan shot the two films on location in Kyoto, Japan, in 2001. They were filmed during the annual Toshiya ceremony, a coming-of-age ritual that has been held in Kyoto’s Sanjûsangen-dô Buddhist temple for more than four hundred years. Every January young men and women come to Kyoto from across Japan to take part in the ceremony, one element of which is a major tournament of kyudo, which the curator Gregor Muir has described as ‘a Japanese style of archery which is not so much about hitting a target, as an exercise in fluidity and smoothness’ (Muir in Tate Modern 2004, p.44). Saint Sebastian was inspired by Tan’s first visit to Japan in 2000 when, during a trip to the Sanjûsangen-dô temple, she found a postcard showing young women practising kyudo. After intensively researching the sport, which had scarcely been documented before, Tan and a small film crew were granted permission to film at the temple during Toshiya. The artist was particularly interested in what she saw as kyudo’s strange combination of themes, ideas and roles, which include ‘traditional ritual and modern day Japanese women, religious practice and military inheritance, youth and cultural history’ (quoted in De Pont Foundation for Contemporary Art 2003, p.49). The title of the work refers to the Christian patron saint of archers and soldiers. The martyrdom of Saint Sebastian, which involved the saint being tied to a stake and shot at with arrows, is a common subject in the history of European painting. In titling her film Saint Sebastian Tan introduces notions of cultural difference, since archery takes on very different associations in kyudo and in the Buddhist context of the Sanjûsangen-dô temple. Tan has outlined the symbolism of archery in the Buddhist faith as follows: There is a Confucian belief that through a person’s archery their true character could be determined. The sound of the string being plucked is supposed to strike fear in evil spirits’ hearts, and the sound of a master-archer shooting is supposed to bring spiritual enlightenment.(Quoted in De Pont Foundation for Contemporary Art 2003, p.50.) Furthermore, Tan has explained that the practice of archery, as well as forming the subject of the film, is itself analogous to filmmaking. In 2003 she drew a comparison between the two through the importance of distance and accuracy: The art of archery and the art of art. The target is so far away that it seems irrelevant. My tools are the camera and the editing table ... A true shot in kyudo is not just one that hits the centre of the target, but one where the arrow can be said to exist in the target before its release.(Quoted in De Pont Foundation for Contemporary Art 2003, p.53.) Tan was born in Indonesia, grew up in Australia and has lived in Europe since the age of eighteen. Her work engages critically with documentary cinema and photography, especially in relation to the representation of different cultures. In the years leading up to the creation of Saint Sebastian Tan made two full-length documentary films, May you live in interesting times 1997 and Kingdom of Shadows 2000 (both on general release). Like Saint Sebastian, these films document practices from various cultures and draw on the history of ethnographic and anthropological cinema. In Saint Sebastian the lack of narration – a technique used in the documentary genre cinéma vérité to suggest that the audience is seeing an unmediated view of the subject – contrasts with the method of cutting between different, often obscured shots and the use of highly evocative music. Each of these techniques draws attention to the artist’s mediation of the women’s appearance and activities. Tan has acknowledged this mediation, stating in 2001 that ‘as an outsider to this culture my touristic gaze cannot be avoided; if anything it will become a part of the piece’ (quoted in De Pont Foundation for Contemporary Art 2003, p.51). Curator Els Hoek has argued that while Tan’s film ‘has unmasked the shameless gaze of the traveller – not to mention the rude manners of the colonialist’, the tender intimacy of the close-up shots in Saint Sebastian equally ‘proves that the mechanical eye can also be in love, be involved with the people whom it registers’ (Hoek in De Pont Foundation for Contemporary Art 2003, p.30).

Although the artist has previously displayed them pinned directly to the wall, they can also be framed. There is no particular order in which they need to be displayed. The photographs feature people whose faces are hidden by tropical fruits, which act as substitutes for heads. Some photographs show a group of people, while others show individuals. Some were taken inside houses; others were taken outside. There are numerous variations on the subjects’ poses and accoutrements, often suggesting work or leisure activities, such as playing golf, fishing or drinking tea. A variety of fruits appear in the series, including watermelons, durians, jackfruits and bunches of bananas. The subjects of the photographs go about their business as if it were normal to have fruit heads. The colourful compositions and absurd combination of fruit heads and human bodies convey a surreal, humorous and cartoon-like aesthetic. As the title suggests, the photographs were taken at the turn of the twenty-first century. A Small Town at the Turn of the Century is representative of Gill’s practice, in which modification and transformation are important concepts. As curator Jessica Morgan has written: ‘Not only do people become fruit, but also books become vegetation, discarded or crushed objects develop mobility, photographs become sculpture, people become books, and books become beads’ (Morgan in Museum of Contemporary Art Sydney 2008, p.60). Transformation is found in Gill’s work on a number of different levels, including artistic genres and media as well as subject matter, questioning and blurring the lines between fixed categorisations. By morphing her sitters’ faces into fruits, Gill equates them with the tropical vegetation associated with their country while leading the artistic genres of portrait and still life to the point of absurdity. The motif of combining human subjects with plants can also be found in a number of Gill’s earlier photographic series. Out of my Hair 1995 (Art Gallery of New South Wales, Sydney), for instance, includes a photograph of a woman who wears a wig made from banana skins. Vegetation 1999 (Art Gallery of New South Wales, Sydney), on the other hand, consists of self-portraits of the artist, whose face is disguised by various plant species local to the landscapes in which the photographs were taken. A Small Town at the Turn of the Century is also representative of Gill’s practices as a whole in its use of natural materials. Her photographs, installations and object-based works often include fruits, fruit skins, tree roots or seeds. While using a cheerful and humorous language, A Small Town at the Turn of the Century nevertheless raises critical questions around identity and postcolonialism. The combination of human subjects with fruits invokes the close relationship between humankind and the plant world and the interrelations between culture and nature. Hiding the faces behind fruits, Gill also shows how identities can be hidden and new ones imposed upon them through visual appearance and habitat. Gill addresses the possibility of multiple and changing identities by demonstrating the arbitrary and manipulable nature of their formation. Furthermore, the playful equation of the Malaysian sitters with tropical fruits raises questions regarding stereotypical associations of other cultures: as with the Malaysian fruits that are exported to the West as exotic products, so Malaysian people are defined by their ‘otherness’. The colourful fruit also playfully allude to traditional memento mori paintings; the lifespan of the fruits, as well as of the people they conceal, is necessarily limited. In addition to photography, Gill’s practice encompasses a variety of other media, including installation, sculpture and writing. As is the case with A Small Town at the Turn of the Century, and the slightly later Dalam 2001 (Tate P14285), her work is often organised in series, challenging rigid typologies and classifications.

Tate,,,,P82138,['Singapore'],Channel #1,"Channel 2014 is a series of twenty-nine near-square format photographs taken in a small mangrove forest on the coast of Port Dickson, Simryn Gill’s hometown in Malaysia. Nine of the photographs are black and white gelatin silver prints and twenty are colour Ilfochrome prints. They can be shown as a full set, in smaller groups or as individual works; there is no specified order in which the pictures are to be hung. The series exists in an edition of two, of which this is the second, plus one artist’s proof. The photographs show the coastal environment of Port Dickson, framed and criss-crossed by mangrove trees. Entangled in the branches and projecting roots are colourful plastic bags and other items of domestic detritus that have been washed up by the rise and fall of the daily tides. Hanging almost like clothes on a washing line, these plastic and fabric remnants have been integrated into Gill’s compositions like an integral part of the landscape. One photograph in the series does not show any litter on the shore, but rather an expanse of sea with a large ship approaching the port. Channel is one of a number of series in which Gill has been concerned with Port Dickson. She has been recording the industrial port town since 1993, using a range of different media from installations of cubes made from termite soil from the area, to photographic series such as Channel. An earlier series of forty photographs, A Small Town at the Turn of the Century 1999–2000 (Tate P13507), includes images shot at the same beach where Channel was made (prints #1, #4 and #16 of A Small Town at the Turn of the Century). Channel is representative of Gill’s practice, in which the use of natural materials and ideas of modification are important concepts. Curator Jessica Morgan has written: ‘Not only do people become fruit, but also books become vegetation, discarded or crushed objects develop mobility, photographs become sculpture, people become books, and books become beads.’ (Jessica Morgan, ‘No Place like Home’, in Storer, Morgan and Taussig 2008, p.60.) Transformation is thus an element of the work on a number of levels, including artistic genres and media as well as the objects photographed. Gill routinely collects shells, driftwood, plastic bottles and shards on the beach, classifying these found objects according to form, colour and material. By choosing to photograph items entangled in the trees, she has added another layer to this practice. The fact that Channel comprises both black and white and colour photographs suggests that the artist was looking at each individual object and scene in detail, for its compositional effect, and exploiting the qualities of the different photographic prints and processes. The gelatin silver prints focus on the dynamic forms of the trees, tangled pieces of litter and the water; the ilfochrome prints accentuate the colours of the found objects and the surrounding environment. Focusing on normally overlooked litter, shaped and expelled by the sea, Channel draws attention to the shipping of products to and from Port Dickson and, more widely, raises questions about migration and globalisation. The contamination of the mangrove forest by plastic waste invokes the complex and difficult relationship between humankind and the environment. In using her last remaining stocks of Ilfochrome paper – which is no longer manufactured – to print the twenty colour photographs of the Channel series, Gill highlights the transient nature of everyday life and our impact on an ever-changing environment, as well as the fugitive nature of the photographic medium itself.

An earlier series of forty photographs, A Small Town at the Turn of the Century 1999–2000 (Tate P13507), includes images shot at the same beach where Channel was made (prints #1, #4 and #16 of A Small Town at the Turn of the Century). Channel is representative of Gill’s practice, in which the use of natural materials and ideas of modification are important concepts. Curator Jessica Morgan has written: ‘Not only do people become fruit, but also books become vegetation, discarded or crushed objects develop mobility, photographs become sculpture, people become books, and books become beads.’ (Jessica Morgan, ‘No Place like Home’, in Storer, Morgan and Taussig 2008, p.60.) Transformation is thus an element of the work on a number of levels, including artistic genres and media as well as the objects photographed. Gill routinely collects shells, driftwood, plastic bottles and shards on the beach, classifying these found objects according to form, colour and material. By choosing to photograph items entangled in the trees, she has added another layer to this practice. The fact that Channel comprises both black and white and colour photographs suggests that the artist was looking at each individual object and scene in detail, for its compositional effect, and exploiting the qualities of the different photographic prints and processes. The gelatin silver prints focus on the dynamic forms of the trees, tangled pieces of litter and the water; the ilfochrome prints accentuate the colours of the found objects and the surrounding environment. Focusing on normally overlooked litter, shaped and expelled by the sea, Channel draws attention to the shipping of products to and from Port Dickson and, more widely, raises questions about migration and globalisation. The contamination of the mangrove forest by plastic waste invokes the complex and difficult relationship between humankind and the environment. In using her last remaining stocks of Ilfochrome paper – which is no longer manufactured – to print the twenty colour photographs of the Channel series, Gill highlights the transient nature of everyday life and our impact on an ever-changing environment, as well as the fugitive nature of the photographic medium itself.

The fact that Channel comprises both black and white and colour photographs suggests that the artist was looking at each individual object and scene in detail, for its compositional effect, and exploiting the qualities of the different photographic prints and processes. The gelatin silver prints focus on the dynamic forms of the trees, tangled pieces of litter and the water; the ilfochrome prints accentuate the colours of the found objects and the surrounding environment. Focusing on normally overlooked litter, shaped and expelled by the sea, Channel draws attention to the shipping of products to and from Port Dickson and, more widely, raises questions about migration and globalisation. The contamination of the mangrove forest by plastic waste invokes the complex and difficult relationship between humankind and the environment. In using her last remaining stocks of Ilfochrome paper – which is no longer manufactured – to print the twenty colour photographs of the Channel series, Gill highlights the transient nature of everyday life and our impact on an ever-changing environment, as well as the fugitive nature of the photographic medium itself.

Tate,,,,P82154,['Singapore'],Channel #17,"Channel 2014 is a series of twenty-nine near-square format photographs taken in a small mangrove forest on the coast of Port Dickson, Simryn Gill’s hometown in Malaysia. Nine of the photographs are black and white gelatin silver prints and twenty are colour Ilfochrome prints. They can be shown as a full set, in smaller groups or as individual works; there is no specified order in which the pictures are to be hung. The series exists in an edition of two, of which this is the second, plus one artist’s proof. The photographs show the coastal environment of Port Dickson, framed and criss-crossed by mangrove trees. Entangled in the branches and projecting roots are colourful plastic bags and other items of domestic detritus that have been washed up by the rise and fall of the daily tides. Hanging almost like clothes on a washing line, these plastic and fabric remnants have been integrated into Gill’s compositions like an integral part of the landscape. One photograph in the series does not show any litter on the shore, but rather an expanse of sea with a large ship approaching the port. Channel is one of a number of series in which Gill has been concerned with Port Dickson. She has been recording the industrial port town since 1993, using a range of different media from installations of cubes made from termite soil from the area, to photographic series such as Channel. An earlier series of forty photographs, A Small Town at the Turn of the Century 1999–2000 (Tate P13507), includes images shot at the same beach where Channel was made (prints #1, #4 and #16 of A Small Town at the Turn of the Century). Channel is representative of Gill’s practice, in which the use of natural materials and ideas of modification are important concepts. Curator Jessica Morgan has written: ‘Not only do people become fruit, but also books become vegetation, discarded or crushed objects develop mobility, photographs become sculpture, people become books, and books become beads.’ (Jessica Morgan, ‘No Place like Home’, in Storer, Morgan and Taussig 2008, p.60.)

Tate,,,,P82162,['Singapore'],Channel #25,"Channel 2014 is a series of twenty-nine near-square format photographs taken in a small mangrove forest on the coast of Port Dickson, Simryn Gill’s hometown in Malaysia. Nine of the photographs are black and white gelatin silver prints and twenty are colour Ilfochrome prints. They can be shown as a full set, in smaller groups or as individual works; there is no specified order in which the pictures are to be hung. The series exists in an edition of two, of which this is the second, plus one artist’s proof. The photographs show the coastal environment of Port Dickson, framed and criss-crossed by mangrove trees. Entangled in the branches and projecting roots are colourful plastic bags and other items of domestic detritus that have been washed up by the rise and fall of the daily tides. Hanging almost like clothes on a washing line, these plastic and fabric remnants have been integrated into Gill’s compositions like an integral part of the landscape. One photograph in the series does not show any litter on the shore, but rather an expanse of sea with a large ship approaching the port. Channel is one of a number of series in which Gill has been concerned with Port Dickson. She has been recording the industrial port town since 1993, using a range of different media from installations of cubes made from termite soil from the area, to photographic series such as Channel. An earlier series of forty photographs, A Small Town at the Turn of the Century 1999–2000 (Tate P13507), includes images shot at the same beach where Channel was made (prints #1, #4 and #16 of A Small Town at the Turn of the Century). Channel is representative of Gill’s practice, in which the use of natural materials and ideas of modification are important concepts. Curator Jessica Morgan has written: ‘Not only do people become fruit, but also books become vegetation, discarded or crushed objects develop mobility, photographs become sculpture, people become books, and books become beads.’ (Jessica Morgan, ‘No Place like Home’, in Storer, Morgan and Taussig 2008, p.60.) Transformation is thus an element of the work on a number of levels, including artistic genres and media as well as the objects photographed. Gill routinely collects shells, driftwood, plastic bottles and shards on the beach, classifying these found objects according to form, colour and material. By choosing to photograph items entangled in the trees, she has added another layer to this practice. The fact that Channel comprises both black and white and colour photographs suggests that the artist was looking at each individual object and scene in detail, for its compositional effect, and exploiting the qualities of the different photographic prints and processes. The gelatin silver prints focus on the dynamic forms of the trees, tangled pieces of litter and the water; the ilfochrome prints accentuate the colours of the found objects and the surrounding environment. Focusing on normally overlooked litter, shaped and expelled by the sea, Channel draws attention to the shipping of products to and from Port Dickson and, more widely, raises questions about migration and globalisation.

Tate,,,,T14130,['Laos'],Neon Rice Field,"Neon Rice Field 1993 is a large floor-based installation consisting of seven tons of dry, white long-grain rice underlaid at intervals with six parallel tubes of red neon light. The overall effect is of an undulating translucent field where the light glows amidst the rice. As with many of Phaophanit’s works, light plays an important role in this installation, binding together the different materials to achieve a particular visual effect. In addition to the work’s visual impact, the rice also generates its own particular smell, which pervades the space beyond the physical limits of the piece. For the artist, Neon Rice Field relies on the ‘interactions of the materials’ (quoted in Tate Gallery 1993, [p.6]) and brings together two utterly disparate things, one natural and organic and the other manufactured and industrial. These materials carry cultural associations that have often been inscribed within the dichotomy between the Western and the Eastern worlds (in this instance, of industry versus agriculture). However, the cultural allegiances that might be attached to them are more complex, more problematic and more fluid than any dualistic reading allows for. Phaophanit often infuses into his work a discreet subversion of the narratives attached to the materials and, while rice is unequivocally a symbol for the East, he has in the past used American sponsorship to supply the rice to stage his work. Likewise, the presence of neon which could sometimes be assumed to represent the western city is also a feature of many Asian cities. Unwilling to attach any predetermined meanings to the work, Phaophanit is concerned with the potential for ‘possibilities of meanings’, and he considers that the materials and their juxtapositions carry their own significance while, at the same time, they open the way to new associations. ‘Once you name all the meanings,’ he has said, ‘something still remains, something left over. That’s how I work. For instance, I use rice not only as a material, a substance, a smell or a symbol of food in the East, but I want to shake things – see what falls down.’ (Quoted in Irish Museum of Modern Art 1997, p. 96.) Born in Laos and educated in France, Phaophanit settled in England in 1985. In 1990 he began to incorporate in his work materials such as rice, rubber and bamboo, which are largely produced in South East Asia and have economic, cultural and historical significance. However, Phaophanit has always opposed any readings of his work that reduce it to a reflection on his cultural identity: Such biographical discourse is very limiting when it comes to talking about the work itself. I don’t only make my work as I do simply because I’m a refugee. It’s also concerned with the way I’m living at the moment. I don’t want to be categorised. I don’t want to be ‘French’ or ‘English’. And I don’t want to be ‘Laotian’.(Vong Phaophanit interviewed by Jonathan Watkins, in Vong Phaophanit: What Falls to the Ground but Can’t be Eaten, exhibition catalogue, Chisenhale Gallery, London 1991, unpaginated.) Neon Rice Field was first exhibited at the Serpentine Gallery, London in 1993 and later the same year at the Aperto section of the 45th Venice Biennale. It was subsequently shown as Phaophanit’s contribution to the Turner Prize at the Tate Gallery, London in 1993. Over the years, it has been shown in different configurations but always incorporating seven tons of white rice spread over six lines of neon lights.

Tate,,,,T13564,['Thailand'],Primitive,"Primitive is a multiple screen video installation, created specifically for display within a gallery, by Thai filmmaker Apichatpong Weerasethakul. It consists of seven videos of differing durations in which the history of the border town of Nabua, in northeast Thailand, is re-imagined as an elusive science fiction ghost story rooted in Thai folklore. The work comprises eight projections, since one of the videos, Primitive which gives the work its name, is shown on two synchronised screens. The seven videos are: Primitive (duration 29 minutes 34 seconds), Nabua (duration 9 minutes 11 seconds), Making of the Spaceship (duration 28 minutes 13 seconds), A Dedicated Machine (duration 1 minute), An Evening Shoot (duration 4 minutes 10 seconds), I'm Still Breathing (music video, duration 11 minutes) and Nabua Song (music video, duration 4 minutes 12 seconds). Nabua, situated where the Mekong River divides Thailand from Laos, was historically the scene of considerable racial strife and violence. From the 1960s until the early 1980s it was a ‘red zone’ where the Mao-influenced Communists hid in the jungle. The Thai army curbed the communist insurgent farmers through physical and psychological abuse and murder. The town also harbours an ancient legend about a widow ghost who would abduct any man who entered her empire, earning it the nickname ‘widow town’. Weerasethakul transforms the town into one of men, the teenage male descendants of the farmer communists, freed from the widow ghost’s empire. These teenagers fabricate their own memories and build a new world, manufacturing a spaceship in the ricefields. For Weerasethakul the jungle is a place of darkness and mystery, in which distinctions between the fictional and the real dissolve. It is a parallel world, populated by enchanted spectres, where mystery and emotion mingle in shadow. The jungle forms a perfect stage for the artist’s fascination with reincarnation, transformation and light. Curator James Quandt has commented that Weerasethakul’s work turns ‘everyday objects and images into the ineffable and enigmatic, inhabitants of a phantom zone where the hard, “real” world of cars and bodies and buildings cedes dominion to a magical realm of reverie and desire’ (Österreichisches Filmmuseum and SYNEMA – Gesellschaft für Film und Medien 2009). The artist has stated that Primitive is ‘a reincarnation of presence (and absence).

Tate,,,,T13564,['Thailand'],Primitive,"Primitive is a multiple screen video installation, created specifically for display within a gallery, by Thai filmmaker Apichatpong Weerasethakul. It consists of seven videos of differing durations in which the history of the border town of Nabua, in northeast Thailand, is re-imagined as an elusive science fiction ghost story rooted in Thai folklore. The work comprises eight projections, since one of the videos, Primitive which gives the work its name, is shown on two synchronised screens. The seven videos are: Primitive (duration 29 minutes 34 seconds), Nabua (duration 9 minutes 11 seconds), Making of the Spaceship (duration 28 minutes 13 seconds), A Dedicated Machine (duration 1 minute), An Evening Shoot (duration 4 minutes 10 seconds), I'm Still Breathing (music video, duration 11 minutes) and Nabua Song (music video, duration 4 minutes 12 seconds). Nabua, situated where the Mekong River divides Thailand from Laos, was historically the scene of considerable racial strife and violence. From the 1960s until the early 1980s it was a ‘red zone’ where the Mao-influenced Communists hid in the jungle. The Thai army curbed the communist insurgent farmers through physical and psychological abuse and murder. The town also harbours an ancient legend about a widow ghost who would abduct any man who entered her empire, earning it the nickname ‘widow town’. Weerasethakul transforms the town into one of men, the teenage male descendants of the farmer communists, freed from the widow ghost’s empire. These teenagers fabricate their own memories and build a new world, manufacturing a spaceship in the ricefields. For Weerasethakul the jungle is a place of darkness and mystery, in which distinctions between the fictional and the real dissolve. It is a parallel world, populated by enchanted spectres, where mystery and emotion mingle in shadow. The jungle forms a perfect stage for the artist’s fascination with reincarnation, transformation and light. Curator James Quandt has commented that Weerasethakul’s work turns ‘everyday objects and images into the ineffable and enigmatic, inhabitants of a phantom zone where the hard, “real” world of cars and bodies and buildings cedes dominion to a magical realm of reverie and desire’ (Österreichisches Filmmuseum and SYNEMA – Gesellschaft für Film und Medien 2009). The artist has stated that Primitive is ‘a reincarnation of presence (and absence). It’s also a reincarnation of cinema as a means of transportation as it was in the time of the early cinema innovator Georges Méliès: the “motion picture” carries us from our own world. Primitive is a meditation on those voyages in fabulous vehicles that bring about the transformation of people and of light’ (unpublished artist’s statement, September 2008).

Tate,,,,T15297,['Philippines'],European Mask,"This is one of a group of three quilted canvas works in Tate’s collection by the Filipino artist Pacita Abad (see also Bacongo III 1986, Tate T15298, and Bacongo IV 1986, Tate T15299). They are part of a series that Abad developed from the late 1970s until the early 1980s. Referring to them as trapuntos, from the Italian word for embroidery or quilt, these works are the artist’s responses to the cultural traditions that she encountered during her travels in Asia, Africa and Latin America, although they also refer to vernacular traditions of sewing – a traditional part of family education in the Philippines. They were made using large pieces of canvas onto which the artist stitched forms, creating a three-dimensional effect by stuffing the canvases and transforming their surface with paint, shells, buttons, beads, mirrors and other objects collected on her travels. Their decorated surfaces integrate a range of patterning techniques to create semi-figurative forms with what look like large eyes set in stylised, mask-like faces. Abad dispensed with stretcher bars and hung these works directly on the wall or from the ceiling and this, combined with the distinctive technique, transformed the relatively flat surface of a picture into something more multi-dimensional. The portability of the trapunto form can be said to resonate with the peripatetic aspect of a migrant existence as experienced by the artist, being an object that can theoretically be rolled up and more easily transported than a stretched painting. Inspired by her travels and interest in responding to cultural traditions in Indonesia, Bangladesh, Sudan, Philippines and elsewhere, Abad’s aim in her work was to connect with the world through a vibrant formal language that integrated her interest in traditional art forms such as batik painting in Indonesia, ink-brush painting in Korea, tie-dye in Africa and macramé in Papua New Guinea, all within a language of abstraction and figuration. Dismayed by Western-centric artistic styles while studying at the Corcoran School of Art in Washington D.C. in the mid-1970s, Abad became interested in social realism and also encountered works by the Mexican muralists Diego Rivera (1886–1957), David Siqueiros (1896–1974) and José Clemente Orozco (1883–1949) during a trip to Mexico in 1986. She sought to rejuvenate different artistic traditions and indigenous forms in order to respond to the social and political realities of communities she encountered, in particular refugees, immigrants and others at the margins of society. Of the artist’s motivations, the curators Joselina Cruz and Pio Abad have written: The narratives which Abad painted to speak about contemporary art and culture in the Philippines were often located elsewhere. Immigration for her was an important issue but more so when she observed the US becoming more disturbed with a changing ‘multiethnic society of legal and illegal immigrants’. Her work was ‘multi-ethnic’ as it brought together experiences across cultures – Bangladesh to Sudan, Sudan to Jakarta, Jakarta to Boston, Washington DC to Manila, Yemen to Singapore – her creative trajectory dictated by her constantly shifting location … Importantly, she also referenced and painted a multiplicity of conditions which were not of her lived experience, but which, at the same time was the story of her life.(Joselina Cruz and Pio Abad, in Museum of Contemporary Art and Design 2018; unpaginated.) Two of the embroidered tapestries in Tate’s collection are from a series entitled Bacongo, referring to the Bantu ethnic group in Central Africa. The third, European Mask, speaks to Abad’s reversal of the co-opting of so-called primitive art by Western artists within the history of modern art. European Mask was installed as part of the work Metro Center Mural: Six Masks from Six Continents at a metro station in Washington D.C. from 1990–3. It was also included in the solo exhibition of the artist’s work at the Museum of Contemporary Art and Design in Manila in 2018, which focused on her trapunto works. The American artist Faith Ringgold (born 1930), who has also worked with quilted canvases, was taken by Abad’s trapunto works and authored a text on her work in the volume Fresh Talk/Daring Gazes: Conversations on Asian American Art edited by Elaine H.

The video exists in an edition of five with two artist’s proofs; Tate’s copy is the second of the artist’s proofs. First performed at Hebbel am Ufer theatre in Berlin in 2000, the twenty-minute performance featured the artist in a short black dress and red high heels attempting to dance on twenty adjacent blocks of melting butter. In the video she enters the stage and carefully positions herself on the butter blocks, proceeding to dance using slow gesticulating movements inspired by traditional Indonesian dance, against the soundtrack of a percussive Indonesian drumbeat that usually accompanies Pakarena – a dance practice from South Sulawesi. During the performance, the artist slips and falls repeatedly, getting up again and again to continue the dance. Performed at a time when she was feeling alienated in her new home in Germany, the work draws on personal experience, using movement and the artist’s own body to explore the space between the viewer and the performer, as well as cross-cultural positions of the insider and the outsider. Suryodarmo has explained: Crossing the boundaries of cultural and political encounters has been a challenge that stimulates me discovering new identification. An effort to find identity is yet a dangerous act of losing the ground of origin. For me, the process of making artwork is a lifelong research that never stops me to put myself inside the metamorphic constellation. I intend to touch the fluid border between the body and its environment through my art works. I aim to create a concentrated level of intensity without the use of narrative structures. Talking about politics, society or psychology makes no sense to me if the nerves are not able to digest the information. (Quoted on artist’s website, http://www.melatisuryodarmo.com/about.html, accessed 12 June 2018.) A student of, and then assistant to, the performance artist Marina Abramovic (born 1946), Suryodarmo’s practice is in part informed by traditional Japanese Butoh dance and history following a chance encounter with the renowned Japanese Butoh dancer and choreographer Anzu Furukawa. Suryodarmo’s father was a practitioner of Amerta (a meditative, non-stylised movement practice) and her mother was a Javanese dancer. These multiple spheres of influence shape her ongoing research into the movements of the body and its relationship to the self and the world. Her work usually takes the form of durational performance documented in video, photography and installation. Often engaging in highly physical acts that involve repetitive movements and labour-intensive processes (such as grinding charcoal briskets in an exhibition hall for twelve hours in I am a Ghost in My Own House 2012), Suryadormo’s performances are non-verbal exchanges of intense engagement that build over time through her own physical output. Here the title ‘Exergie’ – the German form of ‘exergy’ – refers to a thermodynamics term that characterises a state of equilibrium by which maximum useful work is possible while bringing a system into equilibrium that retains heat. In such a state, energy is neither created nor destroyed. For Suryodarmo, it represents ‘a precious moment that can change, in which potential becomes energy’ (email correspondence with Tate curator Clara Kim, 12 June 2018). As with other works, Suryodarmo explores the transgressive nature of performance, subjecting the body – marked by physical difference, cultural specificity, political identity – to exercises of extreme labour, absurd acts and ritualistic movements that elicit empathy, compassion or transcendence. The curator and writer Eva McGovern-Basa has said of this particular work: The sounds of each fall and the anticipation of the next creates an electric tension for an audience that is both sympathetic and fascinated by the futility of her movement. The ‘factual absurdity’ of a woman dancing on butter is then transformed into a poetic action of the artist’s vulnerability … It acts as a form of resistance to larger forces and systems that attempt to subsume her, while allowing her to reflect on the temporary quality of life. (McGovern-Basa 2017, p.76.) Read through a feminist lens, Suryodarmo’s work follows a lineage of artists including Marina Abramovic, Mona Hatoum, Ana Mendieta and Yoko Ono who utilise their bodies to interrogate the dynamics of power, gender and identity, as well as personal and collective histories. The artist has performed this work on numerous occasions at performance festivals in Europe, Canada, Australia, Singapore and Brazil, as well as at Navigate – a festival of live art hosted by the Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art in Newcastle in 2005.

These artworks are reminiscent of the ‘golden age’ of Singaporean cinema during the 1950s and 1960s.

Tate,,,,T15771,['Philippines'],The Collection of Jane Ryan & William Saunders,"The Collection of Jane Ryan & William Saunders 2019 is a sculptural installation presented as a long vitrine showcasing fifteen objects rendered in white 3D-printed plastic. Each object takes the form of an item of ornate fine jewellery, such as a necklace a tiara or a brooch, and is presented on a brass stand according to the display convention of decorative arts museums. Beneath each object is a brief printed description of the item and, in a subversion of traditional museum practices, the equivalent value of the jewellery in public goods and services. For example, in the first two descriptions, ‘A Belle Epoque diamond and platinum tiara, by Cartier’ is equated to ‘The treatment of 12,052 cases of tuberculosis until their full recovery’ and ‘An antique Ceylon sapphire and diamond necklace, by Van Cleef & Arpels’ is equated to ' Electricity to approximately 2,252 households in off-grid area’. The work is accompanied by interpretive texts situated in the gallery, explaining that the objects are replicas of lots in the ‘Hawaii Collection’, a 2016 cancelled auction sale of jewellery that had been seized by United States customs from the deposed leaders of the Philippines, Imelda and Ferdinand Marcos, when they landed in Honolulu, after being granted exile in 1986 by then US President Ronald Reagan. The subject is of particular interest to Abad, whose immediate family were prominent critics of the Marcos dictatorship, to the degree that both of his parents were incarcerated under that regime. The work comments on power, corruption and the ownership of material objects. Jane Ryan and William Saunders were the pseudonyms adopted by Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos in 1968 to set up a Swiss bank account that notoriously became a depository for funds diverted from the Philippine treasury for their private benefit. In Abad and Wadsworth Jones’s ‘collection’, ‘the jewels exist not as luxurious accessories but as a spectral line-up that hovers between evidence and effigy, carrying with it the painful history of a nation’ (artists’ statement, correspondence with Tate curators Clara Kim and Katy Wan, June 2020). The Collection of Jane Ryan & William Saunders is a collaborative work between Pio Abad and his wife, the jewellery designer Frances Wadsworth Jones, whose involvement reveals the technical knowledge and skill required to reconstruct the ‘Hawaii Collection’, for which the artists were only able to access documentary photographs from the cancelled Christie’s auction sale. The work exists in an edition of two with one artists’ proof; Tate’s is the artists’ proof. It was exhibited at Art Jameel in Dubai in 2019–20. This work forms part of a long-term artistic project started by Pio Abad in 2012 on the significance of certain artefacts in the recent history of the Philippines, with particular attention given to the cultural legacy of the Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos regime. Curator Natasha Ginwala has described Abad’s historical investigations as ‘revealing large consequences of … loot as an unauthenticated history, eerily echoing feudal patterns and the generational spread of oligarchic power in the present day.’ (Natasha Ginwala, ‘Corruption: Three Bodies, and Ungovernable Subjects’, e-flux journal, no.67, November 2015, https://www.e-flux.com/journal/67/60724/corruption-three-bodies-and-ungovernable-subjects/, accessed 12 August 2020.)

Tate,,,,P78639,['Myanmar'],"Pindaya, Burma, 1998","Blue Sisters, Structures of Deviance is a portfolio of ten prints executed in blue ink on white paper. Five are photogravures depicting trees. The other five are soft ground etching and aquatint on paper; these images are abstract and have a smaller plate size than the photogravures. The prints were produced at Druckatelier Kurt Zein in Vienna, where the artist lives and works. They were published in an edition of thirty-five with ten artist’s and publisher’s proofs; Tate owns number eleven in the edition. Federle has travelled extensively and for many years has taken photographs of trees during his international journeys. The photographs used in this portfolio were taken on four continents and depict large trees in diverse landscapes. The images are taken from a low viewpoint and cropped so that the tops of the depicted trees are not visible. Federle highlights the structural forms of the trunks and branches, and emphasises the connection between the trees and the ground. The photographic prints are reproduced in a deep blue. Although the source photographs were taken in daylight, the colouration gives the prints a contemplative, nocturnal quality. Federle is known predominantly as a painter (see Norwegian Sight, 1997, Tate T07463). He uses simple geometric forms including segments of the letters of the alphabet as the basis for compositions made with delicate painterly brushstrokes. The etchings in this portfolio are structurally similar to paintings made by the artist in the late 1990s and early twenty-first century in which Federle used a repeated motif of vertical bands. Like the photogravures, the etchings are printed using the artist’s characteristically limited palette. Rather than the deep blue of the representational prints, the abstract etchings are made in a darker blue-grey; the images become progressively looser and less rigidly structured. Federle seeks to convey a sense of spirituality approaching the sublime in his depiction of simple forms and the natural world. He has averred that ‘it can only be the spiritual which satisfies in art’ (quoted in Eva Badura-Triska, ‘1/1, 1/2, 1/4 (to Johannes Itten)’, Helmut Federle 5+1, p.20). The two styles deployed in Blue Sisters suggest contrasting and complementary contemporary approaches to the Romantic. The photogravures are depictions of landscape in the tradition of German Romantic painters including Caspar David Friedrich (1774-1840) while the etchings show the influence of American Abstract Expressionist artists, particularly Mark Rothko (1903-70; see Black on Maroon, 1958, Tate T01166). Speaking about an earlier series, Federle said, ‘I ... handle the abstract vocabulary with the same emotionality and the same symbolization as if I would paint a landscape’ (quoted in Badura-Triska, p.21). The source photograph for this print was taken by the artist in Pindaya, Myanmar (formally Burma) in 1998. It depicts the base of a dead or dying tree, closely cropped so that it dominates almost the entire picture area. Small sections of sky and the leafy branches of other trees are only visible on the left side of the image and in the top right hand corner. The cracked ends of the dead tree’s branches and the blue tint of the photogravure lend an eerie quality, making the tree appear fossilised. Small plants grow up and around the roots, suggesting the potential for renewed growth.

Although the temple is crumbling, its ornate decorative features are still intact. The façade is carved stone and statues of deities are visible in niches. The tree appears to have grown next to one side of the temple, leaning into and finally wrapping itself as it grew around the walls and roof of the building. Roots drape unexpectedly over broken roof tiles. Federle has long-standing interests in ancient cultures and Eastern philosophy. In this image those concerns are combined with a Romantic vision of nature reclaiming human creation.

Although the temple is crumbling, its ornate decorative features are still intact. The façade is carved stone and statues of deities are visible in niches. The tree appears to have grown next to one side of the temple, leaning into and finally wrapping itself as it grew around the walls and roof of the building. Roots drape unexpectedly over broken roof tiles. Federle has long-standing interests in ancient cultures and Eastern philosophy. In this image those concerns are combined with a Romantic vision of nature reclaiming human creation.

Tate,,,,T13702,['Vietnam'],Vietnam II,"Over three metres high and more than twelve metres long, this massive work is Golub’s largest painting and arguably one of his most ambitious. It belongs to a series of three large-scale works on the subject of the Vietnam War the artist made between 1972 and 1974. The paintings were motivated in part by the American presidential election of 1972, which saw Richard Nixon (1913-94) soundly defeating the anti-war platform of George McGovern (born 1922). Golub had adopted an active stance against the Vietnam conflict for almost a decade at the time these works were made; he joined the anti-war group Artists and Writers Protest on his return to the United States in 1964 after living for several years in Europe. However until this series he had not directly addressed contemporary issues in his work. The Vietnam paintings marked a move in Golub’s work from more ambiguous, classically inspired images of masculinity and power (see Fighter, 1965, Tate P77249) to a more pointed and abrasive political engagement with subject matter which has continued in his work to the present day. The composition of Vietnam II is polarised. On the left side of the painting are three uniformed American soldiers in front of an armoured car. All three men brandish machine guns, two of which are pointed towards a group of Vietnamese men, women and children huddled on the far right of the image. Behind the civilians are what appears to be the charred remains of a makeshift building; wooden posts and bits of corrugated iron are covered in a thin, sooty wash of paint. A large expanse of bare canvas divides the two groups of figures. The aggression on the faces of the American soldiers is countered by the combination of horror and stoicism in the expressions of the Vietnamese figures, particularly a young boy positioned in the foreground of the image whose face acts as the focal point for the right side of the composition. He stares directly out of the picture, implicating the viewer in the action. The dynamic postures of the figures were sourced from contemporary news photographs. Golub has described his working process, saying, ‘I begin by projecting drawings or parts of photographs onto the canvas – each figure is a synthesis of different sources ... I want each figure to be both the reconstruction of a generic type and to possess an idiosyncratic singular existence. The figures are first outlined and shaded in black. The second coat emphasizes three dimensionality and designated highlights. I apply local colour to define skin, wood, metal, cloth. The canvas is put on the floor and paint areas are dissolved with solvent and scraped. The main scraping tool is a meat cleaver. Once the canvas has been scraped down, eroded – a process which frequently takes two weeks – I reconstruct the figures’ (quoted in Michael Newman, ‘Interview with Leon Golub’, Leon Golub: Mercenaries and Interrogations, pp.5-6). The process of scraping embeds areas of colour deep in the grain of the support and gives the surface of the painting a rough texture. The painting is executed on unstretched linen, and hangs directly on the wall from grommets positioned at regular intervals along the top of the canvas. Hanging loosely in this manner, the painting is suggestive of an unfurled banner or an animal hide. Along the bottom edge, three irregular forms have been cut away from the painting. These jagged excisions echo the violence depicted in the image in an assault on the fabric of the artwork. Golub originally planned to give the Vietnam paintings the collective title Assassins. In re-naming the paintings he not only situated the depicted conflict in a specific time and place but acknowledged the complexities and moral ambiguities of warfare, suggesting that soldiers ordered to fight in an unjust war are subject to a similar experience of de-humanisation as the civilians who are caught in their crossfire. Writer and curator Jon Bird has elaborated this point, saying, ‘Unlike traditional history painting, in which the historical referent frames and conditions the viewer’s understanding, Golub’s historical project is closer to that of Goya ... whose political “message” problematizes historical responsibility’ (Bird, p.57). Francisco de Goya (1746-1828) is a frequently cited influence on Golub, and the structure of Vietnam II has been compared to Goya’s indictment of the Napoleonic invasion of Spain, Third of May 1808, 1814 (Museo del Prado, Madrid).

Tate,,,,T13564,['Thailand'],Primitive,"Primitive is a multiple screen video installation, created specifically for display within a gallery, by Thai filmmaker Apichatpong Weerasethakul. It consists of seven videos of differing durations in which the history of the border town of Nabua, in northeast Thailand, is re-imagined as an elusive science fiction ghost story rooted in Thai folklore. The work comprises eight projections, since one of the videos, Primitive which gives the work its name, is shown on two synchronised screens. The seven videos are: Primitive (duration 29 minutes 34 seconds), Nabua (duration 9 minutes 11 seconds), Making of the Spaceship (duration 28 minutes 13 seconds), A Dedicated Machine (duration 1 minute), An Evening Shoot (duration 4 minutes 10 seconds), I'm Still Breathing (music video, duration 11 minutes) and Nabua Song (music video, duration 4 minutes 12 seconds). Nabua, situated where the Mekong River divides Thailand from Laos, was historically the scene of considerable racial strife and violence. From the 1960s until the early 1980s it was a ‘red zone’ where the Mao-influenced Communists hid in the jungle. The Thai army curbed the communist insurgent farmers through physical and psychological abuse and murder. The town also harbours an ancient legend about a widow ghost who would abduct any man who entered her empire, earning it the nickname ‘widow town’. Weerasethakul transforms the town into one of men, the teenage male descendants of the farmer communists, freed from the widow ghost’s empire. These teenagers fabricate their own memories and build a new world, manufacturing a spaceship in the ricefields. For Weerasethakul the jungle is a place of darkness and mystery, in which distinctions between the fictional and the real dissolve. It is a parallel world, populated by enchanted spectres, where mystery and emotion mingle in shadow. The jungle forms a perfect stage for the artist’s fascination with reincarnation, transformation and light. Curator James Quandt has commented that Weerasethakul’s work turns ‘everyday objects and images into the ineffable and enigmatic, inhabitants of a phantom zone where the hard, “real” world of cars and bodies and buildings cedes dominion to a magical realm of reverie and desire’ (Österreichisches Filmmuseum and SYNEMA – Gesellschaft für Film und Medien 2009). The artist has stated that Primitive is ‘a reincarnation of presence (and absence). It’s also a reincarnation of cinema as a means of transportation as it was in the time of the early cinema innovator Georges Méliès: the ‘motion picture’ carries us from our own world. Primitive is a meditation on those voyages in fabulous vehicles that bring about the transformation of people and of light’ (unpublished artist’s statement, September 2008). Inspired in part by surrealism, Weerasethakul’s films present a world that is distinctly mutable and elusive, evoking the artist’s interest in the surrealist game Exquisite Corpse, whereby players add words or images sequentially to a sentence or diagram without knowing what came before, so as to construct a fanciful, multi-layered scenario. Conventional narrative unravels as storylines change course and genre morphs from fiction to fantasy to documentary. Drawing heavily on anecdotal traditions from rural Thai villagers, as well as personal politics, social issues and his own early fascination with science fiction, Weerasethakul crafts a unique approach to history which is seemingly caught in an endless cycle of dreams.

In his work ‘the quality and character of the marble, wood, or stone [played] a great part in the conception and in the finish of the subject carved’.[3] In this respect, the rounded forms of Burmese Dancer demonstrated the relative softness of the alabaster, which, as a result, was ‘not usually ... used for carving of great fineness and precision’.[4] With the exception of the deep cutting around the neck and arms, the mass of the block was largely maintained; as seen in the flat back of the figure’s legs. The circular dimple in the upper lip appears to have been drilled, and the face was generally quite crudely cut. A number of blemishes - particularly those on the left side of the head - were filled with plaster or putty. The four curves in the front of the skirt anticipate the use of incised line by both Skeaping and Hepworth over the following years. The choice of a creamy alabaster for Burmese Dancer allowed for a natural translucence. Skeaping worked with the pinkish veins, the most noticeable of which runs through the right side of the head, right breast and leg, and down the centre of the back. Prior to being acquired by the Victoria and Albert Museum, the work had been coated with a wax or varnish which discoloured and was replaced in",1,,

He then lived and worked for a while in Italy, where he met the sculptor Barbara Hepworth, who had been runner-up for the Rome Prize. They were married in Florence. Skeaping first exhibited his work in company with Hepworth at the Reid and Lefevre Gallery in Glasgow in 1928. In that exhibition he showed the head of a Burmese Girl carved in white marble, and it may be that this figure depicts the same model.

Tate,,,,T03768,['Myanmar'],Burmese Dancer,"Skeaping studied at three art schools in London and won the British School at Rome Prize for sculpture in 1924. He then lived and worked for a while in Italy, where he met the sculptor Barbara Hepworth, who had been runner-up for the Rome Prize. They were married in Florence. Skeaping first exhibited his work in company with Hepworth at the Reid and Lefevre Gallery in Glasgow in 1928. In that exhibition he showed the head of a Burmese Girl carved in white marble, and it may be that this figure depicts the same model. However, the work also indicates that Skeaping was interested in the formal characteristics of non-western models.",1,,
Tate,,,,T14130,['Laos'],Neon Rice Field,"Neon Rice Field 1993 is a large floor-based installation consisting of seven tons of dry, white long-grain rice underlaid at intervals with six parallel tubes of red neon light. The overall effect is of an undulating translucent field where the light glows amidst the rice. As with many of Phaophanit’s works, light plays an important role in this installation, binding together the different materials to achieve a particular visual effect. In addition to the work’s visual impact, the rice also generates its own particular smell, which pervades the space beyond the physical limits of the piece. For the artist, Neon Rice Field relies on the ‘interactions of the materials’ (quoted in Tate Gallery 1993, [p.6]) and brings together two utterly disparate things, one natural and organic and the other manufactured and industrial. These materials carry cultural associations that have often been inscribed within the dichotomy between the Western and the Eastern worlds (in this instance, of industry versus agriculture). However, the cultural allegiances that might be attached to them are more complex, more problematic and more fluid than any dualistic reading allows for. Phaophanit often infuses into his work a discreet subversion of the narratives attached to the materials and, while rice is unequivocally a symbol for the East, he has in the past used American sponsorship to supply the rice to stage his work. Likewise, the presence of neon which could sometimes be assumed to represent the western city is also a feature of many Asian cities. Unwilling to attach any predetermined meanings to the work, Phaophanit is concerned with the potential for ‘possibilities of meanings’, and he considers that the materials and their juxtapositions carry their own significance while, at the same time, they open the way to new associations. ‘Once you name all the meanings,’ he has said, ‘something still remains, something left over. That’s how I work. For instance, I use rice not only as a material, a substance, a smell or a symbol of food in the East, but I want to shake things – see what falls down.’ (Quoted in Irish Museum of Modern Art 1997, p. 96.) Born in Laos and educated in France, Phaophanit settled in England in 1985. In 1990 he began to incorporate in his work materials such as rice, rubber and bamboo, which are largely produced in South East Asia and have economic, cultural and historical significance. However, Phaophanit has always opposed any readings of his work that reduce it to a reflection on his cultural identity: Such biographical discourse is very limiting when it comes to talking about the work itself. I don’t only make my work as I do simply because I’m a refugee. It’s also concerned with the way I’m living at the moment. I don’t want to be categorised. I don’t want to be ‘French’ or ‘English’. And I don’t want to be ‘Laotian’.(Vong Phaophanit interviewed by Jonathan Watkins, in Vong Phaophanit: What Falls to the Ground but Can’t be Eaten, exhibition catalogue, Chisenhale Gallery, London 1991, unpaginated.) Neon Rice Field was first exhibited at the Serpentine Gallery, London in 1993 and later the same year at the Aperto section of the 45th Venice Biennale. It was subsequently shown as Phaophanit’s contribution to the Turner Prize at the Tate Gallery, London in 1993. Over the years, it has been shown in different configurations but always incorporating seven tons of white rice spread over six lines of neon lights. Further reading Simon Wilson, ‘Vong Phao",0,,

Tate,,,,T13702,['Vietnam'],Vietnam II,"Vietnam II belongs to a series of three massive paintings that Golub made in protest against the Vietnam War. He had opposed the war since the 1960s but avoided representing it directly in his work, preferring to explore the themes of masculinity and power in a more universal manner. He changed his mind after the 1972 presidential election, in which the anti-war Senator George McGovern was heavily defeated by Richard Nixon. Golub used news photographs and his own experience as a veteran of the Second World War in order to build an allegory of the disconnection generated by conflict. Vietnam II sets American soldiers and their armoured car across a telling central gulf from Vietnamese civilian victims. The contrast between ruthless organisation and panicked disintegration find an echo in the apparently fragmentary nature of the work itself.",0,,
Tate,,,,T13702,['Vietnam'],Vietnam II,"Over three metres high and more than twelve metres long, this massive work is Golub’s largest painting and arguably one of his most ambitious. It belongs to a series of three large-scale works on the subject of the Vietnam War the artist made between 1972 and 1974. The paintings were motivated in part by the American presidential election of 1972, which saw Richard Nixon (1913-94) soundly defeating the anti-war platform of George McGovern (born 1922). Golub had adopted an active stance against the Vietnam conflict for almost a decade at the time these works were made; he joined the anti-war group Artists and Writers Protest on his return to the United States in 1964 after living for several years in Europe. However until this series he had not directly addressed contemporary issues in his work. The Vietnam paintings marked a move in Golub’s work from more ambiguous, classically inspired images of masculinity and power (see Fighter, 1965, Tate P77249) to a more pointed and abrasive political engagement with subject matter which has continued in his work to the present day. The composition of Vietnam II is polarised. On the left side of the painting are three uniformed American soldiers in front of an armoured car. All three men brandish machine guns, two of which are pointed towards a group of Vietnamese men, women and children huddled on the far right of the image. Behind the civilians are what appears to be the charred remains of a makeshift building; wooden posts and bits of corrugated iron are covered in a thin, sooty wash of paint. A large expanse of bare canvas divides the two groups of figures. The aggression on the faces of the American soldiers is countered by the combination of horror and stoicism in the expressions of the Vietnamese figures, particularly a young boy positioned in the foreground of the image whose face acts as the focal point for the right side of the composition. He stares directly out of the picture, implicating the viewer in the action. The dynamic postures of the figures were sourced from contemporary news photographs. Golub has described his working process, saying, ‘I begin by projecting drawings or parts of photographs onto the canvas – each figure is a synthesis of different sources ... I want each figure to be both the reconstruction of a generic type and to possess an idiosyncratic singular existence. The figures are first outlined and shaded in black. The second coat emphasizes three dimensionality and designated highlights. I apply local colour to define skin, wood, metal, cloth. The canvas is put on the floor and paint areas are dissolved with solvent and scraped. The main scraping tool is a meat cleaver. Once the canvas has been scraped down, eroded – a process which frequently takes two weeks – I reconstruct the figures’ (quoted in Michael Newman, ‘Interview with Leon Golub’, Leon Golub: Mercenaries and Interrogations, pp.5-6). The process of scraping embeds areas of colour deep in the grain of the support and gives the surface of the painting a rough texture. The painting is executed on unstretched linen, and hangs directly on the wall from grommets positioned at regular intervals along the top of the canvas. Hanging loosely in this manner, the painting is suggestive of an unfurled banner or an animal hide. Along the bottom edge, three irregular forms have been cut away from the painting. These jagged excisions echo the violence depicted in the image in an assault on the fabric of the artwork. Golub originally planned to give the Vietnam paintings the collective title Assassins. In re-naming the paintings he not only situated the depicted conflict in a specific time and place but acknowledged the complexities and moral ambiguities of warfare, suggesting that soldiers ordered to fight in an unjust war are subject to a similar experience of de-humanisatio",0,,

Purchased from Print Works, Chicago (Grant-in-Aid) 1988 ‘Fighter’, which is printed in purple, depicts a striding male figure with one arm raised. The subject of male combatants has dominated Golub's work since the late 1950s. This particular pose is seen again in ‘Gigantomachy II’, 1966 (the artist, repr., Donald Kuspit, Leon Golub: Existentialist/Activist Painter, New Brunswick 1985, p.135, pls.89–90), one of a series of paintings Golub made between 1965 and 1967 depicting nude males in combat. It is possible that the artist began this painting in 1965, near to the time he made P77249. The reddish tone of the figure in the lithograph, which can be seen as symbolic of vigour, appears to have been carried through into the predominantly red colouration of the figure in the painting. In conversation on 2 November 1988, Golub commented that his fighter images display conflicting traits, reflecting his own ambivalence towards the subject. The fighter in P77249 is, he said, ‘quite heroic in his gestures, the arm is lifted above his head. This gesture is one of alertness and valour’. He continued, ‘my work is continuously between two poles - between aggression and a certain kind of heroism. But it is a heroism which is existential, because [the fighters] can never get out of their fix’. He said that the large scale of the ‘Gigantomachy’ paintings emphasised the heroic nature of the imagery, and that he had intended the ‘Gigantomachy’ series to be viewed from a distance, like Greek temple pediments. The warriors in Golub's paintings of the late 1950s were inspired by ancient Greek sculpture. The artist explained that in this period he was searching for an objective source of imagery, in which the structure of the body was not exaggerated or stylised in a ‘primitivistic manner’. In the early 1970s he began using contemporary magazine and newspaper photographs as sources for his images of soldiers. He aimed to depict current conflicts, and to register his political opposition to the destructive results of military intervention.

Kuspit 1985, p.128, pl.79), which depicts two warriors clashing. P77249 was produced at the Tamarind Lithography Workshop in Los Angeles, California, where Golub worked for six weeks during the summer of 1965. Golub said that he blurred the contours of the figure by erasing and redrawing the lines, in an attempt to capture the effect of a figure in motion. This style of drawing emphasised the figure's vitality and energy. The artist has approved this entry. Published in: Tate Gallery: Illustrated Catalogue of Acquisitions 1986-88, London 1996",0,,

The title of this print refers to the shooting of student demonstrators by the National Guard at a demonstration against American involvement in the Vietnam war held on the campus of Kent State University, Ohio in May 1970. The image is derived from a photograph of a television screen during a BBC news broadcast on the day of the shootings. The circumstances of the making of this print and the decision to make a large edition have been described by the artist as follows: Multiple printings, with the involvement of several printers, hand-workings, and very large amounts of time often spread over months, means that each copy of an edition of seventy or so will be costly to produce and expensive to buy. The likelihood is that the edition will be sold at a reasonable price when published; as the prints change hands later prices can become absurdly high. Just at the time that I was becoming aware of the economic problems inherent in the publication of small editions, Dorothea Leonhart, a Munich dealer, proposed to publish prints in very large editions. It seemed a good moment to try to cut across the situation that had developed in the print market. It is su",0,,
